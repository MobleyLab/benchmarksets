# BRD4(1) Benchmark Set Input Files

## File description

The initial coordinates for all ligands, except Compound 8a, were obtained directly from their respective cocrystal structures, as shown in Table VIII.
To obtain the bound state of Compound 8a, this ligand was docked to the apo BRD4(1) crystal structure with code 4LYI, using the program AutoDock Vina.
