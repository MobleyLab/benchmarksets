Preparation of Host-Guest Benchmark Systems

    This set of files comprises PDB, sd and mol2 files for the free hosts and guests, as well as Amber format input files 
for the solvated and equilibrated host-guest complexes. The guest compounds are named according to the host molecule, 
the benchmark set, and the compound ID listed in Tables 1-4 in the associated paper [1]. For instance, compound p-toluidine is named cb7-2-9 
because it is included in CB7 Set 2, and its ID in the paper is 9. The complexes are named in the same way, 
except that upper case is used to distinguish them from the guest files. 

    The structures of the free CB7 host were initially obtained from the crystal structure [2] and then energy minimized. The structures 
of the free hosts OA and TEMOA, as well as of all unbound guests, were built manually and then energy minimized. The CB7 molecule has zero net charge. 
The OA and TEMOA hosts both were assigned net charges of -8au, based on the pH at which the experiments were conducted (9.2 and 11.5) [3, 4]. 
The protonation states of guests were predicted with the pKa plugin in the Marvin suite of programs [5]. Guest cb7-1-18 is a special case, 
because it was predicted to have the protonated and unprotonated forms coexisting at the experimental pH value (4.74) [6] with a nearly 1:1 ratio. 
Therefore, files of both forms are provided, with cb7-1-18 as the protonated form of the guest and cb7-1-18b as the unprotonated form. 

    For the simulation files, bonded and Lennard-Jones parameters were obtained from the general AMBER force field (GAFF) [7]. 
Electrostatic potentials were computed using Gaussian09 with the HF/6-31G* method. Partial atomic charges were then fitted to the 
electrostatic potentials through the RESP procedure [8], as implemented in the program Antechamber [9]. 

    The starting bound configuration of each host-guest pair was generated by docking the guests into the hosts with MOE [10]. 
The binding pose was then solvated in a cubic box with 2100 TIP3P water molecules for the OA and TEMOA benchmark sets, 
and 1500 TIP3P water molecules for the CB7 sets, with sodium or chloride counterions added only for neutralization. 
Counterions were modeled with the TIP3P-specific sodium parameters of Joung and Cheatham [11]. After an equilibration phase, 
an NVT simulation of 2 ns was carried out, and the frame with the most populated configuration, determined via clustering, 
was selected as the simulation input file.
