    abstract = {The binding energy distribution analysis method (BEDAM) for the computation of receptorâligand standard binding free energies with implicit solvation is presented. The method is based on a well-established statistical mechanics theory of molecular association. It is shown that, in the context of implicit solvation, the theory is homologous to the test particle method of solvation thermodynamics with the soluteâsolvent potential represented by the effective binding energy of the proteinâligand complex. Accordingly, in BEDAM the binding constant is computed by means of a weighted integral of the probability distribution of the binding energy obtained in the canonical ensemble in which the ligand is positioned in the binding site but the receptor and the ligand interact only with the solvent continuum. It is shown that the binding energy distribution encodes all of the physical effects of binding. The balance between binding enthalpy and entropy is seen in our formalism as a balance between favorable and unfavorable binding modes which are coupled through the normalization of the binding energy distribution function. An efficient computational protocol for the binding energy distribution based on the AGBNP2 implicit solvent model, parallel Hamiltonian replica exchange sampling, and histogram reweighting is developed. Applications of the method to a set of known binders and nonbinders of the L99A and L99A/M102Q mutants of T4 lysozyme receptor are illustrated. The method is able to discriminate without error binders from nonbinders, and the computed standard binding free energies of the binders are found to be in good agreement with experimental measurements. Analysis of the results reveals that the binding affinities of these systems reflect the contributions from multiple conformations spanning a wide range of binding energies.},

    abstract = {Binding affinity prediction with implicit solvent models remains a challenge in virtual screening for drug discovery. In order to assess the predictive power of implicit solvent models in docking techniques with Amber scoring, three generalized Born models (GBHCT, GBOBCI, and GBOBCII) available in Dock 6.7 were utilized, for determining the binding affinity of a large set of β-cyclodextrin complexes with 75 neutral guest molecules. The results were compared to potential of mean force (PMF) free energy calculations with four GB models (GBStill, GBHCT, GBOBCI, and GBOBCII) and to experimental data. Docking results yield similar accuracy to the computationally demanding PMF method with umbrella sampling. Neither docking nor PMF calculations reproduce the experimental binding affinities, however, as indicated by a small Spearman rank order coefficient (â0.5). The binding energies obtained from GB models were decomposed further into individual contributions of the binding partners and solvent environments and compared to explicit solvent simulations for five complexes allowing for rationalizing the difference between explicit and implicit solvent models. An important observation is that the explicit solvent screens the interaction between host and guest much stronger than GB models. In contrast, the screening in GB models is too strong in solutes, leading to overestimation of short-range interactions and too strong binding. It is difficult to envision a way of overcoming these two opposite effects.},

    abstract = {We report temperature-dependent acoustic and densimetric data on changes in volume, expansibility, and adiabatic compressibility accompanying the binding of 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid (AD) to β-cyclodextrin (β-CD). We interpret our volumetric results in terms of hydration. Based on our compressibility and expansibility data, we estimate that, at 25 °C, the binding of AD to β-CD is accompanied by displacement of 20 to 25 water molecules from the hydration shells of the two interacting species. Comparison of the temperature-dependent compressibility changes accompanying the binding of AD to β-CD with the compressibility contribution of aliphatic groups suggests that displaced water molecules predominantly come from the hydrophobic loci of AD and β-CD. Thus, we conclude that hydrophobic interactions play a major role in stabilizing the ADâβ-CD complex. Our estimate of the number of water molecules released to the bulk is consistent with structural considerations. There is also good agreement between our volumetric data and osmotic stress results reported by Harries et al. (Harries, D.; Rau, D. C.; Parsegian, V. A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 2184). This observation is consistent with the picture in which the two techniques probe the same population of water molecules solvating AD and β-CD.},

The results have been examined in terms of structural features in the ligands such as the number of alkyl groups, the charge number, the presence of a double bond, branching, and the presence of methyl and methoxy groups. The values of thermodynamic quantities, in particular the standard molar Gibbs energy, correlate well with the structural features in the ligands. These structural correlations can be used for the estimation of thermodynamic quantities for related reactions. Enthalpy?entropy compensation is evident when the individual classes of substances studied herein are considered, but does not hold when these various classes of ligands are considered collectively. The NMR results indicate that the mode of accommodation of the acids and amines in the α-cyclodextrin cavity is very similar, but that the 1-methyl groups in 1-methylhexylamine and in 1-methylheptylamine and the N-methyl group in N-methylhexylamine lie outside the α-cyclodextrin cavity. This latter finding is consistent with the calorimetric results. Many of the thermodynamic and NMR results can be qualitatively understood in terms of van der Waals forces and hydrophobic effects.},

    abstract = {Computational prediction of noncovalent binding free energies with methods based on molecular mechanical force fields has become increasingly routine in drug discovery projects, where they promise to speed the discovery of small molecule ligands to bind targeted proteins with high affinity. Because the reliability of free energy methods still has significant room for improvement, new force fields, or modifications of existing ones, are regularly introduced with the aim of improving the accuracy of molecular simulations. However, comparatively little work has been done to systematically assess how well force fields perform, particularly in relation to the calculation of binding affinities. Hardware advances have made these calculations feasible, but comprehensive force field assessments for proteinâligand sized systems still remain costly. Here, we turn to cyclodextrin hostâguest systems, which feature many hallmarks of proteinâligand binding interactions but are generally much more tractable due to their small size. We present absolute binding free energy and enthalpy calculations, using the attach-pull-release (APR) approach, on a set of 43 cyclodextrin-guest pairs for which experimental ITC data are available. The test set comprises both α- and β-cyclodextrin hosts binding a series of small organic guests, each with one of three functional groups: ammonium, alcohol, or carboxylate. Four water models are considered (TIP3P, TIP4Pew, SPC/E, and OPC), along with two partial charge assignment procedures (RESP and AM1-BCC) and two cyclodextrin host force fields. The results suggest a complex set of considerations when choosing a force field for biomolecular simulations. For example, some force field combinations clearly outperform others at the binding enthalpy calculations but not for the binding free energy. Additionally, a force field combination which we expected to be the worst performer gave the most accurate binding free energies â but the least accurate binding enthalpies. The results have implications for the development of improved force fields, and we propose this test set, and potential future elaborations of it, as a powerful validation suite to evaluate new force fields and help guide future force field development.},

To this end, we have performed initially blind free energy calculations to determine the free energies of binding for ligands of both the CB7 and OA hosts. A subset of the selected guest molecules were those included in the SAMPL4 prediction challenge. Using expanded ensemble simulations in the dimension of coupling host\textendash{}guest intermolecular interactions, we are able to show that our estimates in most cases can be demonstrated to fully converge and that the errors in our estimates are due almost entirely to the assigned force field parameters and the choice of environmental conditions used to model experiment. We confirm the convergence through the use of alternative simulation methodologies and thermodynamic pathways, analyzing sampled conformations, and directly observing changes of the free energy with respect to simulation time. Our results demonstrate the benefits of enhanced sampling of multiple local free energy minima made possible by the use of expanded ensemble molecular dynamics and may indicate the presence of significant problems with current transferable force fields for organic molecules when used for calculating binding affinities, especially in non-protein chemistries.},

Model systems with high quality experimental data are valuable instruments for the validation and improvement of effective potentials. With respect to protein\textendash{}ligand binding, organic host\textendash{}guest complexes have long served as models for both experimental and computational studies because of the abundance of binding affinity data available for such systems. Binding affinity data collected for cyclodextrin (CD) inclusion complexes, a popular model for molecular recognition, is potentially a more reliable resource for tuning energy parameters than hydration free energy measurements. Convergence of binding free energy calculations on CD host\textendash{}guest systems can also be obtained rapidly, thus offering the opportunity to assess the robustness of these parameters. In this work, we demonstrate how implicit solvent parameters can be developed using binding affinity experimental data and the binding energy distribution analysis method (BEDAM) and validated using the Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory analysis. These new solvation parameters were used to study protein\textendash{}ligand binding in two drug targets against the HIV-1 virus and improved the agreement between the calculated and the experimental binding affinities. This work illustrates how benchmark sets of high quality experimental binding affinity data and physics-based binding free energy models can be used to evaluate and optimize force fields for protein\textendash{}ligand systems.

Here, we used the mining minima (M2) method to predict cucurbit[7]uril binding affinities from the SAMPL4 blind prediction challenge. We tested two different energy models, an empirical classical force field, CHARMm with VCharge charges, and the Poisson\textendash{}Boltzmann surface area solvation model; and a semiempirical quantum mechanical (QM) Hamiltonian, PM6-DH+, coupled with the COSMO solvation model and a surface area term for nonpolar solvation free energy. Binding affinities based on the classical force field correlated strongly with the experiments with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.74. On the other hand, binding affinities based on the QM energy model correlated poorly with experiments (R2 = 0.24), due largely to two major outliers. As we used extensive conformational search methods, these results point to possible inaccuracies in the PM6-DH+ energy model or the COSMO solvation model. Furthermore, the different binding free energy components, solute energy, solvation free energy, and configurational entropy showed significant deviations between the classical M2 and quantum M2 calculations. Comparison of different classical M2 free energy components to experiments show that the change in the total energy, i.e. the solute energy plus the solvation free energy, is the key driving force for binding, with a reasonable correlation to experiment (R2 = 0.56); however, accounting for configurational entropy further improves the correlation.},

  abstract = {Electrostatic free energies play an essential role in numerous biomolecular processes occurring in solution. Difficulties arise when the long-range Coulomb interaction is computed for idealised infinite simulation models with periodic boundary conditions. To maintain a neutral simulation box and a finite per-box energy, a neutralising charge density or `gellium' is commonly used, leading to a mean box potential that is constrained to be rigorously equal to zero at all times. Thus, in considering quantities such as ion solvation free energy, the potential drop to move from solvent into the usual, gas phase reference state is missing. In fact, for an infinite molecular system, the electrostatic potential itself is not uniquely defined, but takes the form of an infinite series that is only conditionally convergent. This leads to several possible computational conventions that give different values for the potential and field, all mathematically valid. For experimentally measurable quantities, however, unique results are obtained when sufficiently large simulation boxes are utilised. These concepts are detailed, as well as a fundamental, linear response theoretical framework that provides qualitative understanding of the physical processes involved, especially dielectric relaxation of the environment in response to a new solute charge. Illustrative applications to ligand binding and biomolecular electron transfer are described.},

  abstract = {The displacement of perturbed water upon binding is believed to play a critical role in the thermodynamics of biomolecular recognition, but it is nontrivial to unambiguously define and answer questions about this process. We address this issue by introducing grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (GIST), which discretizes the equations of inhomogeneous solvation theory (IST) onto a three-dimensional grid situated in the region of interest around a solute molecule or complex. Snapshots from explicit solvent simulations are used to estimate localized solvation entropies, energies, and free energies associated with the grid boxes, or voxels, and properly summing these thermodynamic quantities over voxels yields information about hydration thermodynamics. GIST thus provides a smoothly varying representation of water properties as a function of position, rather than focusing on hydration sites where solvent is present at high density. It therefore accounts for full or partial displacement of water from sites that are highly occupied by water, as well as for partly occupied and water-depleted regions around the solute. GIST can also provide a well-defined estimate of the solvation free energy and therefore enables a rigorous end-states analysis of binding. For example, one may not only use a first GIST calculation to project the thermodynamic consequences of displacing water from the surface of a receptor by a ligand, but also account, in a second GIST calculation, for the thermodynamics of subsequent solvent reorganization around the bound complex. In the present study, a first GIST analysis of the molecular host cucurbit[7]uril is found to yield a rich picture of hydration structure and thermodynamics in and around this miniature receptor. One of the most striking results is the observation of a toroidal region of high water density at the center of the host\&apos;s nonpolar cavity. Despite its high density, the water in this toroidal region is disfavored energetically and entropically, and hence may contribute to the known ability of this small receptor to bind guest molecules with unusually high affinities. Interestingly, the toroidal region of high water density persists even when all partial charges of the receptor are set to zero. Thus, localized regions of high solvent density can be generated in a binding site without strong, attractive solute-solvent interactions.},

The predictions were in poor agreement with experiment, and we conjectured that much of the error might derive from the force field, CHARMm with Vcharge charges. Repeating the calculations with other generalized force-fields led to no significant improvement, and we observed that the predicted affinities were highly sensitive to the choice of force-field. We therefore embarked on a systematic evaluation of a set of generalized force fields, based upon comparisons with PM6-DH2, a fast yet accurate semi-empirical quantum mechanics method. In particular, we compared gas-phase interaction energies and entropies for the host\textendash{}guest complexes themselves, as well as for smaller chemical fragments derived from the same molecules. The mean deviations of the force field interaction energies from the quantum results were greater than 3 kcal/mol and 9 kcal/mol, for the fragments and host\textendash{}guest systems respectively. We further evaluated the accuracy of force-fields for computing the vibrational entropies and found the mean errors to be greater than 4 kcal/mol. Given these errors in energy and entropy, it is not surprising in retrospect that the predicted binding affinities deviated from the experiment by several kcal/mol. These results emphasize the need for improvements in generalized force-fields and also highlight the importance of systematic evaluation of force-field parameters prior to evaluating different free-energy methods.},

Adamantane based derivatives which snuggly fit within the pocket of octa-acid deep cavity cavitands exhibit some of the strongest host binding. Here we explore the roles of guest size and attractiveness on optimizing guest binding to form 1:1 complexes with octa-acid cavitands in water. Specifically we simulate the water-mediated interactions of the cavitand with adamantane and a range of simple Lennard-Jones guests of varying diameter and attractive well-depth. Initial simulations performed with methane indicate hydrated methanes preferentially reside within the host pocket, although these guests frequently trade places with water and other methanes in bulk solution. The interaction strength of hydrophobic guests increases with increasing size from sizes slightly smaller than methane to Lennard-Jones guests comparable in size to adamantane. Over this guest size range the preferential guest binding location migrates from the bottom of the host pocket upwards. For guests larger than adamantane, however, binding becomes less favorable as the minimum in the potential-of-mean force shifts to the cavitand face around the portal. For a fixed guest diameter, the Lennard-Jones well-depth is found to systematically shift the guest-host potential-of-mean force to lower free energies, however, the optimal guest size is found to be insensitive to increasing well-depth. Ultimately our simulations show that adamantane lies within the optimal range of guest sizes with significant attractive interactions to match the most tightly bound Lennard-Jones guests studied.},

Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to determine the standard molar enthalpy change ($\Delta$H$^\circ$) and binding constant (K a), and hence the Gibbs free energy ($\Delta$G$^\circ$) and entropy ($\Delta$S$^\circ$) change for the different complexes. The thermodynamic determinations were carried out from 288 to 318 K, allowing the standard molar heat capacity changes also to be derived. Typical of the processes driven by the hydrophobic effect, was observed to be proportional to the accessible (non-polar) surface area of the guest. The cyclic and acyclic guests displayed opposite trends; the heat capacity penalty upon binding increased with longer aliphatic chains, while the opposite was observed with the cyclic guests.},

  abstract = {We have estimated free energies for the binding of nine cyclic carboxylate guest molecules to the octa-acid host in the SAMPL4 blind-test challenge with four different approaches. First, we used standard free-energy perturbation calculations of relative binding affinities, performed at the molecular-mechanics (MM) level with TIP3P waters, the GAFF force field, and two different sets of charges for the host and the guest, obtained either with the restrained electrostatic potential or AM1-BCC methods. Both charge sets give good and nearly identical results, with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 4 kJ/mol and a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.8 compared to experimental results. Second, we tried to improve these predictions with 28,800 density-functional theory (DFT) calculations for selected snapshots and the non-Boltzmann Bennett acceptance-ratio method, but this led to much worse results, probably because of a too large difference between the MM and DFT potential-energy functions. Third, we tried to calculate absolute affinities using minimised DFT structures. This gave intermediate-quality results with MADs of 5\textendash{}9 kJ/mol and R2 = 0.6\textendash{}0.8, depending on how the structures were obtained. Finally, we tried to improve these results using local coupled-cluster calculations with single and double excitations, and non-iterative perturbative treatment of triple excitations (LCCSD(T0)), employing the polarisable multipole interactions with supermolecular pairs approach. Unfortunately, this only degraded the predictions, probably because of a mismatch between the solvation energies obtained at the DFT and LCCSD(T0) levels.},

  abstract = {Free energy simulations for electrostatic and charging processes in complex molecular systems encounter specific difficulties owing to the long-range, 1/r Coulomb interaction. To calculate the solvation free energy of a simple ion, it is essential to take into account the polarization of nearby solvent but also the electrostatic potential drop across the liquid\textendash{}gas boundary, however distant. The latter does not exist in a simulation model based on periodic boundary conditions because there is no physical boundary to the system. An important consequence is that the reference value of the electrostatic potential is not an ion in a vacuum. Also, in an infinite system, the electrostatic potential felt by a perturbing charge is conditionally convergent and dependent on the choice of computational conventions. Furthermore, with Ewald lattice summation and tinfoil conducting boundary conditions, the charges experience a spurious shift in the potential that depends on the details of the simulation system such as the volume fraction occupied by the solvent. All these issues can be handled with established computational protocols, as reviewed here and illustrated for several small ions and three solvated proteins.},

Association constants in sodium tetraborate buffered (pH 9.2) aqueous solution ranged from 5.39 \texttimes{} 102 M-1 in the case of benzoate 1, up to 3.82 \texttimes{} 105 M-1 for trans-4-methylcyclohexanoate 7. Overall, the free energy difference between the free energies of complexation of these weakest and strongest binding guests was $\Delta\Delta$G$^\circ$ = 3.88 kcal mol-1. Based on a multitude of previous studies, the anticipated order of strength of binding was close to that which was actually obtained. However, the binding of guest 3 (4-ethylbenzoate) was considerably stronger than initially estimated.},

  abstract = {Accurately predicting binding affinities between ligands and macromolecules has been a much sought-after goal. A tremendous amount of resources can be saved in the pharmaceutical industry through accurate binding-affinity prediction and hence correct decision-making for the drug discovery processes. Owing to the structural complexity of macromolecules, one of the issues in binding affinity prediction using molecular dynamics is the adequate sampling of the conformational space. Recently, the funnel metadynamics method (Limongelli et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110:6358, 2013) was developed to enhance the sampling of the ligand at the binding site as well as in the solvated state, and offer the possibility to predict the absolute binding free energy. We apply funnel metadynamics to predict host\textendash{}guest binding affinities for the cucurbit[7]uril host as part of the SAMPL4 blind challenge. Using total simulation times of 300\textendash{}400 ns per ligand, we show that the errors due to inadequate sampling are below 1 kcal/mol. However, despite the large investment in terms of computational time, the results compared to experiment are not better than a random guess. As we obtain differences of up to 11 kcal/mol when switching between two commonly used force fields (with automatically generated parameters), we strongly believe that in the pursuit of accurate binding free energies a more careful force-field parametrization is needed to address this type of system.},

  abstract = {Conformational change in protein\textendash{}ligand complexes is widely modeled, but the protein accommodation expected on binding a congeneric series of ligands has received less attention. Given their use in medicinal chemistry, there are surprisingly few substantial series of congeneric ligand complexes in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Here we determine the structures of eight alkyl benzenes, in single-methylene increases from benzene to n-hexylbenzene, bound to an enclosed cavity in T4 lysozyme. The volume of the apo cavity suffices to accommodate benzene but, even with toluene, larger cavity conformations become observable in the electron density, and over the series two other major conformations are observed. These involve discrete changes in main-chain conformation, expanding the site; few continuous changes in the site are observed. In most structures, two discrete protein conformations are observed simultaneously, and energetic considerations suggest that these conformations are low in energy relative to the ground state. An analysis of 121 lysozyme cavity structures in the PDB finds that these three conformations dominate the previously determined structures, largely modeled in a single conformation. An investigation of the few congeneric series in the PDB suggests that discrete changes are common adaptations to a series of growing ligands. The discrete, but relatively few, conformational states observed here, and their energetic accessibility, may have implications for anticipating protein conformational change in ligand design.},

The second case, consisting of two neutral thrombin ligands that are taken from a recent medicinal chemistry program for this interesting pharmaceutical target, is of particular significance in that it demonstrates that good results can be obtained for large, complex ligands, as opposed to relatively simple model systems. To achieve quantitative agreement with experiment in the thrombin case, a next generation force field, Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations 2.0, is required, which provides superior charges and torsional parameters as compared to earlier alternatives.},

  abstract = {Molecular docking computationally screens thousands to millions of organic molecules against protein structures, looking for those with complementary fits. Many approximations are made, often resulting in low ``hit rates.'' A strategy to overcome these approximations is to rescore top-ranked docked molecules using a better but slower method. One such is afforded by molecular mechanics\textendash{}generalized Born surface area (MM\textendash{}GBSA) techniques. These more physically realistic methods have improved models for solvation and electrostatic interactions and conformational change compared to most docking programs. To investigate MM\textendash{}GBSA rescoring, we re-ranked docking hit lists in three small buried sites: a hydrophobic cavity that binds apolar ligands, a slightly polar cavity that binds aryl and hydrogen-bonding ligands, and an anionic cavity that binds cationic ligands. These sites are simple; consequently, incorrect predictions can be attributed to particular errors in the method, and many likely ligands may actually be tested. In retrospective calculations, MM\textendash{}GBSA techniques with binding-site minimization better distinguished the known ligands for each cavity from the known decoys compared to the docking calculation alone. This encouraged us to test rescoring prospectively on molecules that ranked poorly by docking but that ranked well when rescored by MM\textendash{}GBSA. A total of 33 molecules highly ranked by MM\textendash{}GBSA for the three cavities were tested experimentally. Of these, 23 were observed to bind\textemdash{}these are docking false negatives rescued by rescoring. The 10 remaining molecules are true negatives by docking and false positives by MM\textendash{}GBSA. X-ray crystal structures were determined for 21 of these 23 molecules. In many cases, the geometry prediction by MM\textendash{}GBSA improved the initial docking pose and more closely resembled the crystallographic result; yet in several cases, the rescored geometry failed to capture large conformational changes in the protein. Intriguingly, rescoring not only rescued docking false positives, but also introduced several new false positives into the top-ranking molecules. We consider the origins of the successes and failures in MM\textendash{}GBSA rescoring in these model cavity sites and the prospects for rescoring in biologically relevant targets.},

  abstract = {A model binding site was used to investigate charge\textendash{}charge interactions in molecular docking. This simple site, a small (180 {\AA}3) engineered cavity in cyctochrome c peroxidase (CCP), is negatively charged and completely buried from solvent, allowing us to explore the balance between electrostatic energy and ligand desolvation energy in a system where many of the common approximations in docking do not apply. A database with about 5300 molecules was docked into this cavity. Retrospective testing with known ligands and decoys showed that overall the balance between electrostatic interaction and desolvation energy was captured. More interesting were prospective docking scre"ens that looked for novel ligands, especially those that might reveal problems with the docking and energy methods. Based on screens of the 5300 compound database, both high-scoring and low-scoring molecules were acquired and tested for binding. Out of 16 new, high-scoring compounds tested, 15 were observed to bind. All of these were small heterocyclic cations. Binding constants were measured for a few of these, they ranged between 20 $\mu$M and 60 $\mu$M. Crystal structures were determined for ten of these ligands in complex with the protein. The observed ligand geometry corresponded closely to that predicted by docking. Several low-scoring alkyl amino cations were also tested and found to bind. The low docking score of these molecules owed to the relatively high charge density of the charged amino group and the corresponding high desolvation penalty. When the complex structures of those ligands were determined, a bound water molecule was observed interacting with the amino group and a backbone carbonyl group of the cavity. This water molecule mitigates the desolvation penalty and improves the interaction energy relative to that of the ``naked'' site used in the docking screen. Finally, six low-scoring neutral molecules were also tested, with a view to looking for false negative predictions. Whereas most of these did not bind, two did (phenol and 3-fluorocatechol). Crystal structures for these two ligands in complex with the cavity site suggest reasons for their binding. That these neutral molecules do, in fact bind, contradicts previous results in this site and, along with the alkyl amines, provides instructive false negatives that help identify weaknesses in our scoring functions. Several improvements of these are considered.},

  abstract = {Prediction of interaction energies between ligands and their receptors remains a major challenge for structure-based inhibitor discovery. Much effort has been devoted to developing scoring schemes that can successfully rank the affinities of a diverse set of possible ligands to a binding site for which the structure is known. To test these scoring functions, well-characterized experimental systems can be very useful. Here, mutation-created binding sites in T4 lysozyme were used to investigate how the quality of atomic charges and solvation energies affects molecular docking. Atomic charges and solvation energies were calculated for 172,118 molecules in the Available Chemicals Directory using a semi-empirical quantum mechanical approach by the program AMSOL\textdagger\textdagger{}http://t1.chem.umn.edu/amsol
. The database was first screened against the apolar cavity site created by the mutation Leu99$\rightarrow$Ala (L99A). Compared to the electronegativity-based charges that are widely used, the new charges and desolvation energies improved ranking of known apolar ligands, and better distinguished them from more polar isosteres that are not observed to bind. To investigate whether the new charges had predictive value, the non-polar residue Met102, which forms part of the binding site, was changed to the polar residue glutamine. The structure of the resulting Leu99$\rightarrow$Ala and Met102$\rightarrow$Gln double mutant of T4 lysozyme (L99A/M102Q) was determined and the docking calculation was repeated for the new site. Seven representative polar molecules that preferentially docked to the polar versus the apolar binding site were tested experimentally. All seven bind to the polar cavity (L99A/M102Q) but do not detectably bind to the apolar cavity (L99A). Five ligand-bound structures of L99A/M102Q were determined by X-ray crystallography. Docking predictions corresponded to the crystallographic results to within 0.4 {\AA} RMSD. Improved treatment of partial atomic charges and desolvation energies in database docking appears feasible and leads to better distinction of true ligands. Simple model binding sites, such as L99A and its more polar variants, may find broad use in the development and testing of docking algorithms.},

  abstract = {We present a method to identify small molecule ligand binding sites and poses within a given protein crystal structure using GPU-accelerated Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. The Hamiltonians used vary from the physical end state of protein interacting with the ligand to an unphysical end state where the ligand does not interact with the protein. As replicas explore the space of Hamiltonians interpolating between these states, the ligand can rapidly escape local minima and explore potential binding sites. Geometric restraints keep the ligands from leaving the vicinity of the protein and an alchemical pathway designed to increase phase space overlap between intermediates ensures good mixing. Because of the rigorous statistical mechanical nature of the Hamiltonian exchange framework, we can also extract binding free energy estimates for all putative binding sites. We present results of this methodology applied to the T4 lysozyme L99A model system for three known ligands and one non-binder as a control, using an implicit solvent. We find that our methodology identifies known crystallographic binding sites consistently and accurately for the small number of ligands considered here and gives free energies consistent with experiment. We are also able to analyze the contribution of individual binding sites to the overall binding affinity. Our methodology points to near term potential applications in early-stage structure-guided drug discovery.},

  abstract = {We report here NMR and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry studies of the binding of ionisable guests (carboxylate acids) to a deep-cavity cavitand. These studies reveal that the shortest guests favoured 1:1 complex formation, but the longer the alkyl chain the more the 2:1 host-guest capsule is favoured. For intermediate-sized guests, the equilibrium between these two states is controlled by pH; at low values the capsule containing the carboxylic acid guest is favoured, whereas as the pH is raised deprotonation of the guest favours the 1:1 complex. Interestingly, for one host\textendash{}guest pair the energy required to decap the 2:1 capsular complex and form the 1:1 complex is sufficient to shift the pKa of the guest by 3\textendash{}4 orders of magnitude (4.1\textendash{}5.4 kcal mol-1). The two largest guests examined form stable 2:1 capsules, with in both cases the guest adopting a relatively high energy J-shaped motif. Furthermore, these 2:1 complexes are sufficiently stable that at high pH guest deprotonation occurs without decapping of the capsule.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jmb.2009.09.049},
  abstract = {We present a combined experimental and modeling study of organic ligand molecules binding to a slightly polar engineered cavity site in T4 lysozyme (L99A/M102Q). For modeling, we computed alchemical absolute binding free energies. These were blind tests performed prospectively on 13 diverse, previously untested candidate ligand molecules. We predicted that eight compounds would bind to the cavity and five would not; 11 of 13 predictions were correct at this level. The RMS error to the measurable absolute binding energies was 1.8 kcal/mol. In addition, we computed "relative" binding free energies for six phenol derivatives starting from two known ligands: phenol and catechol. The average RMS error in the relative free energy prediction was 2.5 kcal/mol (phenol) and 1.1 kcal/mol (catechol). To understand these results at atomic resolution, we obtained x-ray co-complex structures for nine of the diverse ligands and for all six phenol analogs. The average RMSD of the predicted pose to the experiment was 2.0 A (diverse set), 1.8 A (phenol-derived predictions), and 1.2 A (catechol-derived predictions). We found that predicting accurate affinities and rank-orderings required near-native starting orientations of the ligand in the binding site. Unanticipated binding modes, multiple ligand binding, and protein conformational change all proved challenging for the free energy methods. We believe that these results can help guide future improvements in physics-based absolute binding free energy methods.},

We made systematic improvements, beginning with single poses from docking, then including multiple poses, additional protein conformational changes, and using an improved charge model. Computed absolute binding free energies had an RMS error of 1.9 kcal/mol relative to previously determined experimental values. In blind prospective tests, the methods correctly discriminated between several true ligands and decoys in a set of putative binders identified by docking. In these prospective tests, the RMS error in predicted binding free energies relative to those subsequently determined experimentally was only 0.6 kcal/mol. X-ray crystal structures of the new ligands bound in the cavity corresponded closely to predictions from the free energy calculations, but sometimes differed from those predicted by docking. Finally, we examined the impact of holding the protein rigid, as in docking, with a view to learning how approximations made in docking affect accuracy and how they may be improved.},

  doi = {10.1002/jcc.23490},
  abstract = {The calculation of binding free energies of charged species to a target molecule is a frequently encountered problem in molecular dynamics studies of (bio-)chemical thermodynamics. Many important endogenous receptor-binding molecules, enzyme substrates, or drug molecules have a nonzero net charge. Absolute binding free energies, as well as binding free energies relative to another molecule with a different net charge will be affected by artifacts due to the used effective electrostatic interaction function and associated parameters (e.g., size of the computational box). In the present study, charging contributions to binding free energies of small oligoatomic ions to a series of model host cavities functionalized with different chemical groups are calculated with classical atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. Electrostatic interactions are treated using a lattice-summation scheme or a cutoff-truncation scheme with Barker\textendash{}Watts reaction-field correction, and the simulations are conducted in boxes of different edge lengths. It is illustrated that the charging free energies of the guest molecules in water and in the host strongly depend on the applied methodology and that neglect of correction terms for the artifacts introduced by the finite size of the simulated system and the use of an effective electrostatic interaction function considerably impairs the thermodynamic interpretation of guest-host interactions. Application of correction terms for the various artifacts yields consistent results for the charging contribution to binding free energies and is thus a prerequisite for the valid interpretation or prediction of experimental data via molecular dynamics simulation. Analysis and correction of electrostatic artifacts according to the scheme proposed in the present study should therefore be considered an integral part of careful free-energy calculation studies if changes in the net charge are involved. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors Journal of Computational Chemistry Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  volume = {139},
  doi = {10.1063/1.4826261},
  abstract = {The calculation of a protein-ligand binding free energy based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations generally relies on a thermodynamic cycle in which the ligand is alchemically inserted into the system, both in the solvated protein and free in solution. The corresponding ligand-insertion free energies are typically calculated in nanoscale computational boxes simulated under periodic boundary conditions and considering electrostatic interactions defined by a periodic lattice-sum. This is distinct from the ideal bulk situation of a system of macroscopic size simulated under non-periodic boundary conditions with Coulombic electrostatic interactions. This discrepancy results in finite-size effects, which affect primarily the charging component of the insertion free energy, are dependent on the box size, and can be large when the ligand bears a net charge, especially if the protein is charged as well. This article investigates finite-size effects on calculated charging free energies using as a test case the binding of the ligand 2-amino-5-methylthiazole (net charge +1 e) to a mutant form of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase in water. Considering different charge isoforms of the protein (net charges -5, 0, +3, or +9 e), either in the absence or the presence of neutralizing counter-ions, and sizes of the cubic computational box (edges ranging from 7.42 to 11.02 nm), the potentially large magnitude of finite-size effects on the raw charging free energies (up to 17.1 kJ\,mol-1) is demonstrated. Two correction schemes are then proposed to eliminate these effects, a numerical and an analytical one. Both schemes are based on a continuum-electrostatics analysis and require performing Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) calculations on the protein-ligand system. While the numerical scheme requires PB calculations under both non-periodic and periodic boundary conditions, the latter at the box size considered in the MD simulations, the analytical scheme only requires three non-periodic PB calculations for a given system, its dependence on the box size being analytical. The latter scheme also provides insight into the physical origin of the finite-size effects. These two schemes also encompass a correction for discrete solvent effects that persists even in the limit of infinite box sizes. Application of either scheme essentially eliminates the size dependence of the corrected charging free energies (maximal deviation of 1.5 kJ\,mol-1). Because it is simple to apply, the analytical correction scheme offers a general solution to the problem of finite-size effects in free-energy calculations involving charged solutes, as encountered in calculations concerning, e.g., protein-ligand binding, biomolecular association, residue mutation, pKa and redox potential estimation, substrate transformation, solvation, and solvent-solvent partitioning.},

  abstract = {In simulations, molecular dispersion interactions are frequently neglected beyond a cutoff of around 1 nm. In some cases, analytical corrections appropriate for isotropic systems are applied to the pressure and/or the potential energy. Here, we show that in systems containing macromolecules, either of these approaches introduce statistically significant errors in some observed properties; for example, the choice of cutoff can affect computed free energies of ligand binding to proteins by 1 to 2 kcal/mol. We review current methods for eliminating this cutoff-dependent behavior of the dispersion energy and identify some situations where they fail. We introduce two new formalisms, appropriate for binding free energy calculations, which overcome these failings, requiring minimal computational effort beyond the time required to run the original simulation. When these cutoff approximations are applied, which can be done after all simulations are completed, results are consistent across simulations run with different cutoffs. In many situations, simulations can be run with even shorter cutoffs than typically used, resulting in increased computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {We present a new estimator for computing free energy differences and thermodynamic expectations as well as their uncertainties from samples obtained from multiple equilibrium states via either simulation or experiment. The estimator, which we call the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (MBAR) because it reduces to the Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (BAR) when only two states are considered, has significant advantages over multiple histogram reweighting methods for combining data from multiple states. It does not require the sampled energy range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases. Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias.},

  abstract = {Here, our interest is in predicting solubility in general, and we focus particularly on predicting how the solubility of particular solutes is modulated by the solvent environment. Solubility in general is extremely important, both for theoretical reasons - it provides an important probe of the balance between solute-solute and solute-solvent interactions - and for more practical reasons, such as how to control the solubility of a given solute via modulation of its environment, as in process chemistry and separations. Here, we study how the change of solvent affects the solubility of a given compound. That is, we calculate relative solubilities. We use MD simulations to calculate relative solubility and compare our calculated values with experiment as well as with results from several other methods, SMD and UNIFAC, the latter of which is commonly used in chemical engineering design. We find that straightforward solubility calculations based on molecular simulations using a general small-molecule force field outperform SMD and UNIFAC both in terms of accuracy and coverage of the relevant chemical space.},

  abstract = {Predicting the rate of nonfacilitated permeation of solutes across lipid bilayers is important to drug design, toxicology, and signaling. These rates can be estimated using molecular dynamics simulations combined with the inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model, which requires calculation of the potential of mean force and position-dependent diffusivity of the solute along the transmembrane axis. In this paper, we assess the efficiency and accuracy of several methods for the calculation of the permeability of a model DMPC bilayer to urea, benzoic acid, and codeine. We compare umbrella sampling, replica exchange umbrella sampling, adaptive biasing force, and multiple-walker adaptive biasing force for the calculation of the transmembrane PMF. No definitive advantage for any of these methods in their ability to predict the membrane permeability coefficient Pm was found, provided that a sufficiently long equilibration is performed. For diffusivities, a Bayesian inference method was compared to a generalized Langevin method, both being sensitive to chosen parameters and the slow relaxation of membrane defects. Agreement within 1.5 log units of the computed Pm with experiment is found for all permeants and methods. Remaining discrepancies can likely be attributed to limitations of the force field as well as slowly relaxing collective movements within the lipid environment. Numerical calculations based on model profiles show that Pm can be reliably estimated from only a few data points, leading to recommendations for calculating Pm from simulations.},

  abstract = {Accurate predictions of free energies of binding of ligands to proteins are challenging partly because of the nonadditivity of protein\textendash{}ligand interactions; i.e., the free energy of binding is the sum of numerous enthalpic and entropic contributions that cannot be separated into functional group contributions. In principle, molecular simulations methodologies that compute free energies of binding do capture nonadditivity of protein\textendash{}ligand interactions, but efficient protocols are necessary to compute well-converged free energies of binding that clearly resolve nonadditive effects. To this end, an efficient GPU-accelerated implementation of alchemical free energy calculations has been developed and applied to two congeneric series of ligands of the enzyme thrombin. The results show that accurate binding affinities are computed across the two congeneric series and positive coupling between nonpolar R1 substituents and a X = NH3+ substituent is reproduced, albeit with a weaker trend than experimentally observed. By contrast, a docking methodology completely fails to capture nonadditive effects. Further analysis shows that the nonadditive effects are partly due to variations in the strength of a hydrogen-bond between the X = NH3+ ligands family and thrombin residue Gly216. However, other partially compensating interactions occur across the entire binding site, and no single interaction dictates the magnitude of the nonadditive effects for all the analyzed protein\textendash{}ligand complexes.},

Low molecular weight receptors and their ligands\textemdash{}i.e., host\textendash{}guest systems\textemdash{}represent valuable test-beds for such affinity prediction methods, because their small size makes for fast calculations and relatively facile numerical convergence. The SAMPL3 community exercise included the first ever blind prediction challenge for host\textendash{}guest binding affinities, through the incorporation of 11 new host\textendash{}guest complexes. Ten participating research groups addressed this challenge with a variety of approaches. Statistical assessment indicates that, although most methods performed well at predicting some general trends in binding affinity, overall accuracy was not high, as all the methods suffered from either poor correlation or high RMS errors or both. There was no clear advantage in using explicit versus implicit solvent models, any particular force field, or any particular approach to conformational sampling. In a few cases, predictions using very similar energy models but different sampling and/or free-energy methods resulted in significantly different results. The protonation states of one host and some guest molecules emerged as key uncertainties beyond the choice of computational approach. The present results have implications for methods development and future blind prediction exercises.},

However, the accuracy of docking calculations can be limited by factors such as the neglect of protein reorganization in the scoring function; as a result, ligand screening can produce a high rate of false positive hits. Although absolute binding free energy methods still have difficulty in accurately rank-ordering binders, we believe that they can be fruitfully employed to distinguish binders from nonbinders and reduce the false positive rate. Here we study a set of ligands that dock favorably to a newly discovered, potentially allosteric site on the flap of HIV-1 protease. Fragment binding to this site stabilizes a closed form of protease, which could be exploited for the design of allosteric inhibitors. Twenty-three top-ranked protein\textendash{}ligand complexes from AutoDock were subject to the free energy screening using two methods, the recently developed binding energy analysis method (BEDAM) and the standard double decoupling method (DDM). Free energy calculations correctly identified most of the false positives ($\geq$83\%) and recovered all the confirmed binders. The results show a gap averaging $\geq$3.7 kcal/mol, separating the binders and the false positives. We present a formula that decomposes the binding free energy into contributions from the receptor conformational macrostates, which provides insights into the roles of different binding modes. Our binding free energy component analysis further suggests that improving the treatment for the desolvation penalty associated with the unfulfilled polar groups could reduce the rate of false positive hits in docking. The current study demonstrates that the combination of docking with free energy methods can be very useful for more accurate ligand screening against valuable drug targets.},

  abstract = {An important unsolved problem in materials science is prediction of the thermodynamic stability of organic crystals and their solubility from first principles. Solubility can be defined as the saturating concentration of a molecule within a liquid solvent, where the physical picture is of solvated molecules in equilibrium with their solid phase. Despite the importance of solubility in determining the oral bioavailability of pharmaceuticals, prediction tools are currently limited to quantitative structure\textendash{}property relationships that are fit to experimental solubility measurements. For the first time, we describe a consistent procedure for the prediction of the structure, thermodynamic stability, and solubility of organic crystals from molecular dynamics simulations using the polarizable multipole AMOEBA force field. Our approach is based on a thermodynamic cycle that decomposes standard state solubility into the sum of solid\textendash{}vapor sublimation and vapor\textendash{}liquid solvation free energies $\Delta$Gsolubility$^\circ$ = $\Delta$Gsub$^\circ$ + $\Delta$Gsolv$^\circ$, which are computed via the orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) sampling strategy. Application to the n-alkylamides series from acetamide through octanamide was selected due to the dependence of their solubility on both amide hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic effect, which are each fundamental to protein structure and solubility. On average, the calculated absolute standard state solubility free energies are accurate to within 1.1 kcal/mol. The experimental trend of decreasing solubility as a function of n-alkylamide chain length is recapitulated by the increasing stability of the crystalline state and to a lesser degree by decreasing favorability of solvation (i.e., the hydrophobic effect). Our results suggest that coupling the polarizable AMOEBA force field with an orthogonal space based free energy algorithm, as implemented in the program Force Field X, is a consistent procedure for predicting the structure, thermodynamic stability, and solubility of organic crystals.},

  abstract = {The solubility of organic molecules is of critical importance to the pharmaceutical industry; however, robust computational methods to predict this quantity from first-principles are lacking. Solubility can be computed from a thermodynamic cycle that decomposes standard state solubility into the sum of solid\textendash{}vapor sublimation and vapor\textendash{}liquid solvation free energies $\Delta$Gsolubility$^\circ$ = $\Delta$Gsub$^\circ$ + $\Delta$Gsolv$^\circ$. Over the past few decades, alchemical simulation methods to compute solvation free energy using classical force fields have become widely used. However, analogous methods for determining the free energy of the sublimation/deposition phase transition are currently limited by the necessity of a priori knowledge of the atomic coordinates of the crystal. Here, we describe progress toward an alternative scheme based on growth of the asymmetric unit into a crystal via alchemy (GAUCHE). GAUCHE computes deposition free energy $\Delta$Gdep$^\circ$ = -$\Delta$Gsub$^\circ$ = -kBT ln(Vc/Vg) + $\Delta$GAU + $\Delta$GAU$\rightarrow$UC as the sum of an entropic term to account for compressing a vapor at 1 M standard state (Vg) into the molar volume of the crystal (Vc), where kB is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature in degrees Kelvin, plus two simulation steps. In the first simulation step, the deposition free energy $\Delta$GAU for a system composed of only NAU asymmetric unit (AU) molecule(s) is computed beginning from an arbitrary conformation in vacuum. In the second simulation step, the change in free energy $\Delta$GAU$\rightarrow$UC to expand the asymmetric unit degrees of freedom into a unit cell (UC) composed of NUC independent molecules is computed. This latter step accounts for the favorable free energy of removing the constraint that every symmetry mate of the asymmetric unit has an identical conformation and intermolecular interactions. The current work is based on NVT simulations, which requires knowledge of the crystal space group and unit cell parameters from experiment, but not a priori knowledge of crystalline atomic coordinates. GAUCHE was applied to 5 organic molecules whose sublimation free energy has been measured experimentally, based on the polarizable AMOEBA force field and more than a microsecond of sampling per compound in the program Force Field X. The mean unsigned and RMS errors were only 1.6 and 1.7 kcal/mol, respectively, which indicates that GAUCHE is capable of accurate prediction of absolute sublimation thermodynamics.},

In the present study we have assessed the average accuracy of free energy calculations for a total of 92 ligands binding to five different targets. To make this study and future larger scale applications possible we automated the setup procedure. Starting from user defined binding modes, the procedure decides which ligands to connect via a perturbation based on maximum common substructure criteria and produces all necessary parameter files for free energy calculations in AMBER 11. For the systems investigated, errors due to insufficient sampling were found to be substantial in some cases whereas differences in estimators (thermodynamic integration (TI) versus multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR)) were found to be negligible. Analytical uncertainty estimates calculated from a single free energy calculation were found to be much smaller than the sample standard deviation obtained from two independent free energy calculations. Agreement with experiment was found to be system dependent ranging from excellent to mediocre (RMSE = [0.9, 8.2, 4.7, 5.7, 8.7] kJ/mol). When restricting analyses to free energy calculations with sample standard deviations below 1 kJ/mol agreement with experiment improved (RMSE = [0.8, 6.9, 1.8, 3.9, 5.6] kJ/mol).},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of standard binding free energies describing protein\textendash{}ligand association remains a daunting computational endeavor. This challenge is rooted to a large extent in the considerable changes in conformational, translational, and rotational entropies underlying the binding process that atomistic simulations cannot easily sample. In spite of significant methodological advances, reflected in a continuously improving agreement with experiment, a characterization of alternate strategies aimed at measuring binding affinities, notably their respective advantages and drawbacks, is somewhat lacking. Here, two distinct avenues to determine the standard binding free energy are compared in the case of a short, proline-rich peptide associating to the Src homology domain 3 of tyrosine kinase Abl. These avenues, one relying upon alchemical transformations and the other on potentials of mean force (PMFs), invoke a series of geometrical restraints acting on collective variables designed to alleviate sampling limitations inherent to classical molecular dynamics simulations. The experimental binding free energy of $\Delta$Gbind = -7.99 kcal/mol is well reproduced by the two strategies developed herein, with $\Delta$Gbind = -7.7 for the alchemical route and $\Delta$Gbind = -7.8 kcal/mol for the alternate PMF-based route. In detailing the underpinnings of these numerical strategies devised for the accurate determination of standard binding free energies, many practical elements of the proposed rigorous, conceptual framework are clarified, thereby paving way to tackle virtually any recognition and association phenomenon.},

  abstract = {The emergence of HIV-1 drug-resistant mutations is the major problem against AIDS treatment. We employed molecular dynamics (MD) calculations and free energy (MM\textendash{}PBSA and thermodynamic integration) analyses on wild-type (WT) and mutated HIV-1 protease (HIV-1 PR) complexes with darunavir, amprenavir, indinavir, and saquinavir to clarify the mechanism of resistance due to the I50V flap mutation. Conformational analysis showed that the protease flaps are increasingly flexible in the I50V complexes. In the WT, stabilization of the HIV-1 PR structure is achieved via interflap and water-mediated hydrogen-bonding interactions between the flaps. Furthermore, hydrogen bonds between drugs and binding cavity residues (Asp29/29${'}$/30/30${'}$) are crucial for effective inhibition. All these interactions were significantly diminished (or absent) in the mutated forms, thus denoting their importance toward binding. Thermodynamic integration calculations reproduced the experimental data to within $\approx$1 kcal mol\textendash{}1 and showed that the I50V mutation results in weaker binding free energies for all analyzed complexes with respect to the WT. It was observed that the loss in binding energy upon mutation was mostly enthalpically driven in all complexes, with the greatest effect coming from the reduction of van der Waals interactions. Our results motivated us to test two novel compounds that have been synthesized to maximize interactions with HIV-1 PR. MM\textendash{}PBSA and TI calculations showed that compound 3c (Ghosh et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2012, 22, 2308) is a promising protease inhibitor, which presents very effective binding to the WT PR ($\Delta$GMM\textendash{}PBSA = -17.2 kcal mol\textendash{}1, $\Delta$Gexp = -16.1 kcal mol\textendash{}1). Upon I50V mutation, the complex binding free energy was weakened by a $\Delta\Delta$GTI of 1.8 kcal mol\textendash{}1, comparable to the marketed inhibitors. This predicts that I50V may confer low resistance to 3c. This computational comparative study contributes toward elucidation of the I50V drug-resistance mechanism in HIV-1 PR.},

The synthesis of a water-soluble, deep cavitand is described. The route comprises six (linear) steps from commercially available precursors, and it relies on the fourfold oligomeric cyclization reaction of resorcinol with 2,3-dihydrofuran that leads to the formation of a shallow resorcinarene framework; condensation with aromatic panels, which deepens the hydrophobic binding cavity; construction of rigid urea functionalities on the upper rim; and the introduction of the water-solubilizing methylimidazolium groups on the lower rim. Late intermediates of the synthesis can be used in the preparation of congener cavitands with different properties and applications, and a sample of such a synthetic procedure is included in this protocol. Emphasis is placed on scaled-up reactions and on purification procedures that afford materials in high yield and avoid chromatographic purification. This protocol provides improvements over previously described procedures, and it enables the preparation of sizable amounts of deep cavitands: 7 g of a water-soluble cavitand can be prepared from resorcinol in 13 working days.

  abstract = {Molecular docking programs screen chemical databases for novel ligands that fit protein binding sites. When one compound fits the site well, close analogs typically do the same. Therefore, many of the compounds that are found in such screens resemble one another. This reduces the variety and novelty of the compounds suggested. In an attempt to increase the diversity of docking hit lists, the Available Chemicals Directory was grouped into families of related structures. All members of every family were docked and scored, but only the best scoring molecule of a high-ranking family was allowed in the hit list. The identity and scores of the other members of these families were recorded as annotations to the best family member, but they were not independently ranked. This family-based docking method was compared with molecule-by-molecule docking in screens against the structures of thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and the cavity site of the mutant T4 lysozyme Leu99 $\rightarrow$ Ala (L99A). In each case, the diversity of the hit list increased, and more families of known ligands were found. To investigate whether the newly identified hits were sensible, we tested representative examples experimentally for binding to L99A and DHFR. Of the six compounds tested against L99A, five bound to the internal cavity. Of the seven compounds tested against DHFR, six inhibited the enzyme with apparent Ki values between 0.26 and 100 $\mu$M. The segregation of potential ligands into families of related molecules is a simple technique to increase the diversity of candidates suggested by database screens.

  abstract = {Sampling receptor flexibility is challenging for database docking. We consider a method that treats multiple flexible regions of the binding site independently, recombining them to generate different discrete conformations. This algorithm scales linearly rather than exponentially with the receptor's degrees of freedom. The method was first evaluated for its ability to identify known ligands of a hydrophobic cavity mutant of T4 lysozyme (L99A). Some 200,000 molecules of the Available Chemical Directory (ACD) were docked against an ensemble of cavity conformations. Surprisingly, the enrichment of known ligands from among a much larger number of decoys in the ACD was worse than simply docking to the apo conformation alone. Large decoys, accommodated in the larger cavity conformations sampled in the ensemble, were ranked better than known small ligands. The calculation was redone with an energy correction term that considered the cost of forming the larger cavity conformations. Enrichment improved, as did the balance between high-ranking large and small ligands. In a second retrospective test, the ACD was docked against a conformational ensemble of thymidylate synthase. Compared to docking against individual enzyme conformations, the flexible receptor docking approach improved enrichment of known ligands. Including a receptor conformational energy weighting term improved enrichment further. To test the method prospectively, the ACD database was docked against another cavity mutant of lysozyme (L99A/M102Q). A total of 18 new compounds predicted to bind this polar cavity and to change its conformation were tested experimentally; 14 were found to bind. The bound structures for seven ligands were determined by X-ray crystallography. The predicted geometries of these ligands all corresponded to the observed geometries to within 0.7 {\AA} RMSD or better. Significant conformational changes of the cavity were observed in all seven complexes. In five structures, part of the observed accommodations were correctly predicted; in two structures, the receptor conformational changes were unanticipated and thus never sampled. These results suggest that although sampling receptor flexibility can lead to novel ligands that would have been missed when docking a rigid structure, it is also important to consider receptor conformational energy.},

Application of $\lambda$-dynamics to this system gives a reasonable estimate of the binding affinity of the ligands. This methodology also provides a means to explore the binding orientations and conformations of the ligands inside the binding pocket much better than does conventional MD. This is due to the scaling of forces inherent in the $\lambda$-dynamics method, which lowers the barriers separating different binding modes and conformations. Examination of the $\lambda$-dynamics trajectory of the ligands revealed alternative binding orientations and conformations not detected by crystallography. Furthermore, a $\lambda$-dynamics simulation starting from random initial orientations, in which some ligands take significantly different orientations as compared with those from the X-ray structure, successfully samples the X-ray crystallographic orientations in all ligands. Ligand sampling by conventional MD starting from same initial structures remains trapped in the local minima from which they start. Such efficient sampling of ligand orientations and conformations is expected to diminish the limitation that an initial ligand structure must be close to its true bound orientation in order to yield a reasonable estimate of the binding free energy.},

Application of $\lambda$ dynamics using a multiple topology approach resulted in trapping in local minima. To extend the method to these cases, a new restraining potential was devised and added to the extended Hamiltonian. Two approximations were introduced in order to estimate the binding free energy within small simulation times using this potential: (a) The entropy terms related to the restraining potential are assumed to cancel, due to the similarity of the ligands. (b) The restraining potential calculated from the coordinates of the environmental atoms during a $\lambda$-dynamics simulation is assumed to be equal to that of the average coordinates. Relatively short $\lambda$-dynamics simulations with this restraining potential successfully yielded reasonable estimates of the binding affinity of the ligands as compared with both experimental data and free energy perturbation calculations. Long time $\lambda$-dynamics simulations with a ten-ligand system revealed that better ligands tend to have small statistical errors, which is appropriate for screening out the plausible ligands from all candidates. Furthermore, short time $\lambda$-dynamics simulations with ten identical ligands demonstrated that sufficient precision was achieved for putative discovery of tight binding ligands or guests.},

  abstract = {A previously proposed electron transfer (ET) pathway in the heme enzyme cytochrome c peroxidase has been excised from the structure, leaving an open ligand-binding channel in its place. Earlier studies on cavity mutants of this enzyme have revealed structural plasticity in this region of the molecule. Analysis of these structures has allowed the design of a variant in which the specific section of protein backbone representing a previously proposed ET pathway is accurately extracted from the protein. A crystal structure verified the creation of an open channel that overlays the removed segment, extending from the surface of the protein to the heme at the core of the protein. A number of heterocyclic cations were found to bind to the proximal-channel mutant with affinities that can be rationalized based on the structures. It is proposed that small ligands bind more weakly to the proximal-channel mutant than to the W191G cavity due to an increased off rate of the open channel, whereas larger ligands are able to bind to the channel mutant without inducing large conformational changes. The structure of benzimidazole bound to the proximal-channel mutant shows that the ligand accurately overlays the position of the tryptophan radical center that was removed from the wild-type enzyme and displaces four of the eight ordered solvent molecules seen in the empty cavity. Ligand binding also caused a small rearrangement of the redesigned protein loop, perhaps as a result of improved electrostatic interactions with the ligand. The engineered channel offers the potential for introducing synthetic replacements for the removed structure, such as sensitizer-linked substrates. These installed ``molecular wires'' could be used to rapidly initiate reactions, trap reactive intermediates, or answer unresolved questions about ET pathways.},

  abstract = {Cavity complementation has been observed in many proteins, where an appropriate small molecule binds to a cavity-forming mutant. Here, the binding of compounds to the W191G cavity mutant of cytochrome c peroxidase is characterized by X-ray crystallography and binding thermodynamics. Unlike cavities created by removal of hydrophobic side-chains, the W191G cavity does not bind neutral or hydrophobic compounds, but displays a strong specificity for heterocyclic cations, consistent with the role of the protein to stabilize a tryptophan radical at this site. Ligand dissociation constants for the protonated cationic state ranged from 6 $\mu$M for 2-amino-5-methylthiazole to 1 mM for neutral ligands, and binding was associated with a large enthalpy-entropy compensation. X-ray structures show that each of 18 compounds with binding behavior bind specifically within the artificial cavity and not elsewhere in the protein. The compounds make multiple hydrogen bonds to the cavity walls using a subset of the interactions seen between the protein and solvent in the absence of ligand. For all ligands, every atom that is capable of making a hydrogen bond does so with either protein or solvent. The most often seen interaction is to Asp235, and most compounds bind with a specific orientation that is defined by their ability to interact with this residue. Four of the ligands do not have conventional hydrogen bonding atoms, but were nevertheless observed to orient their most polar CH bond towards Asp235. Two of the larger ligands induce disorder in a surface loop between Pro190 and Asn195 that has been identified as a mobile gate to cavity access. Despite the predominance of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, the small variation in observed binding free energies were not correlated readily with the strength, type or number of hydrogen bonds or with calculated electrostatic energies alone. Thus, as with naturally occurring binding sites, affinities to W191G are likely to be due to a subtle balance of polar, non-polar, and solvation terms. These studies demonstrate how cavity complementation and judicious choice of site can be used to produce a protein template with an unusual ligand-binding specificity.},

However, only four of the proteins gave acceptable errors, correlations, and rankings. The results could be improved by using nine intermediate states in the simulations or including the entire protein in the simulations using periodic boundary conditions. However, 27 of the calculated affinities still gave errors of more than 4 kJ/mol, and for three of the proteins the results were not satisfactory. This shows that the performance of BAR calculations depends on the target protein and that several transformations gave poor results owing to limitations in the molecular-mechanics force field or the restricted sampling possible within a reasonable simulation time. Still, the BAR results are better than docking calculations for most of the proteins.},

However, the performance of existing computationally demanding binding free energy calculation methods in this context is largely unknown. We analyzed the performance of the molecular mechanics continuum solvent, the linear interaction energy (LIE), and the thermodynamic integration (TI) approach for three sets of compounds from industrial lead optimization projects. The data sets pose challenges typical for this early stage of drug discovery. None of the methods was sufficiently predictive when applied out of the box without considering these challenges. Detailed investigations of failures revealed critical points that are essential for good binding free energy predictions. When data set-specific features were considered accordingly, predictions valuable for lead optimization could be obtained for all approaches but LIE. Our findings lead to clear recommendations for when to use which of the above approaches. Our findings also stress the important role of expert knowledge in this process, not least for estimating the accuracy of prediction results by TI, using indicators such as the size and chemical structure of exchanged groups and the statistical error in the predictions. Such knowledge will be invaluable when it comes to the question which of the TI results can be trusted for decision making.},

  abstract = {Additivity of functional group contributions to protein\textendash{}ligand binding is a very popular concept in medicinal chemistry as the basis of rational design and optimized lead structures. Most of the currently applied scoring functions for docking build on such additivity models. Even though the limitation of this concept is well known, case studies examining in detail why additivity fails at the molecular level are still very scarce. The present study shows, by use of crystal structure analysis and isothermal titration calorimetry for a congeneric series of thrombin inhibitors, that extensive cooperative effects between hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bond formation are intimately coupled via dynamic properties of the formed complexes. The formation of optimal lipophilic contacts with the surface of the thrombin S3 pocket and the full desolvation of this pocket can conflict with the formation of an optimal hydrogen bond between ligand and protein. The mutual contributions of the competing interactions depend on the size of the ligand hydrophobic substituent and influence the residual mobility of ligand portions at the binding site. Analysis of the individual crystal structures and factorizing the free energy into enthalpy and entropy demonstrates that binding affinity of the ligands results from a mixture of enthalpic contributions from hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts, and entropic considerations involving an increasing loss of residual mobility of the bound ligands. This complex picture of mutually competing and partially compensating enthalpic and entropic effects determines the non-additivity of free energy contributions to ligand binding at the molecular level.},

The inhibitors have small structural variations at the para position of the benzamidinium ion. They show small differences in relative binding affinity but large compensating differences in enthalpy and entropy. Binding affinity decreases with increased branching at the first carbon but increases with increasing the length of a linear alkyl substituent, suggesting that steric hindrance and hydrophobic interactions play dominant roles in binding. Structural analysis showed that the backbone of the enzyme was unaffected by the change of the para substituent. In addition, binding does not correlate strongly with octanol/water partition data. To further characterize this system, the change in the heat capacity on binding, the change in solvent-accessible surface area on binding, the effect of inhibitor binding on the hydration of the active site, the pKa of His57, and interactions within the catalytic triad have been investigated. Although the changes in inhibitor structure are small, it is demonstrated that simple concepts such as steric hindrance, hydrophobicity, and buried surface area are insufficient to explain the binding data. Other factors, such as access to the binding site and the cost of dehydration of the active site, are of equal or greater importance.},

  abstract = {Several combinations of free energy calculation methods have been applied to determine the relative free energies of binding between eight para-substituted benzamidines in complex with the serine protease trypsin. With the aim to improve efficiency and maintain accuracy, the linear response approximation (LRA), linear interaction energy (LIE) and third power fitting (TPF) are combined with the one-step perturbation (OSP) to determine the polar and apolar contributions to the free energy, respectively. It is shown that the combination TPF/OSP gives the most accurate results and is 4.5 times more efficient than the rigorous thermodynamic integration (TI). By projecting the electrostatic preorganization energy from the OSP simulations, an increase in efficiency of a factor 7.5 can even be achieved. Loss of accuracy with respect to the TI data is limited to 3.9 and 5.6 kJ/mol, respectively, making it an attractive approach for lead optimization programs in drug research.},

  abstract = {The binding of charged ligands benzamidine and diazamidine to trypsin was investigated by using a polarizable potential energy function and explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations. The binding free energies were computed from the difference between the free energies of decoupling the ligand from water and protein environments. Both the absolute and the relative free energies from the perturbation simulations agree with experimental measurements to within 0.5 kcal$\cdot$mol-1. Comparison of free-energy components sampled from different thermodynamic paths indicates that electrostatics is the main driving force behind benzamidine recognition of trypsin. The contribution of electronic polarization to binding appears to be crucial. By computing the free-energy contribution caused by the polarization between the ligand and its surroundings, we found that polarization has the opposite effect in dissimilar environments. Although polarization favors ligand solvation in water, it weakens the protein\textendash{}ligand attraction by screening the electrostatic interaction between trypsin and benzamidine. We also examined the relative binding free energies of a benzamidine analog diazamidine to trypsin. The changes in free energy on benzamidine-diazamidine substitution were tens of kilocalories in both water and trypsin environments; however, the change in the total binding free energy is $<$2 kcal$\cdot$mol-1 because of cancellation, consistent with the experimental results. Overall, our results suggest that the use of a polarizable force field, given adequate sampling, is capable of achieving chemical accuracy in molecular simulations of protein\textendash{}ligand recognition.},

The inhibitors investigated were initially proposed as part of the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Free Energy Evaluation (CATFEE) project for which no experimental results nor any assessment of the predictions submitted by various groups have ever been published. The inhibitors studied represent a severe challenge for explicit free energy calculations. The mutations from one compound to another involve up to 19 atoms, the creation and annihilation of net charge and several alternate binding modes. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain highly converged results ($\pm$ 5\textendash{}10 kJ/mol) even for such complex multi-atom mutations by simulating on a nanosecond time scale. This is achieved by using soft-core potentials to facilitate the creation and deletion of atoms and by a careful choice of mutation pathway. The results show that given modest computational resources, explicit free energy calculations can be successfully applied to realistic problems in drug design.},

  abstract = {We have calculated the binding free energies of a series of benzamidine-like inhibitors to trypsin with a polarizable force field using both explicit and implicit solvent approaches. Free energy perturbation has been performed for the ligands in bulk water and in protein complex with molecular dynamics simulations. The binding free energies calculated from explicit solvent simulations are well within the accuracy of experimental measurement and the direction of change is predicted correctly in all cases. We analyzed the molecular dipole moments of the ligands in gas, water and protein environments. Neither binding affinity nor ligand solvation free energy in bulk water shows much dependence on the molecular dipole moments of the ligands. Substitution of the aromatic or the charged group in the ligand results in considerable change in the solvation energy in bulk water and protein whereas the binding affinity varies insignificantly due to cancellation. The effect of chemical modification on ligand charge distribution is mostly local. Replacing benzene with diazine has minimal impact on the atomic multipoles at the amidinium group. We have also utilized an implicit solvent based end-state approach to evaluate the binding free energies of these inhibitors. In this approach, the polarizable multipole model combined with Poisson-Boltzmann/surface area (PMPB/SA) provides the electrostatic interaction energy and the polar solvation free energy. Overall the relative binding free energies obtained from the MM-PMPB/SA model are in good agreement with the experimental data. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 2009},

The computational protocol leveraged docking and high level atomistic models to improve enrichment. The enrichment factor of our blind predictions ranked best among all of the computational submissions, and second best overall. This work represents to our knowledge the first example of the application of an all-atom physics-based binding free energy model to large scale virtual screening. A total of 285 parallel Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics absolute protein-ligand binding free energy simulations were conducted starting from docked poses. The setup of the simulations was fully automated, calculations were distributed on multiple computing resources and were completed in a 6-weeks period. The accuracy of the docked poses and the inclusion of intramolecular strain and entropic losses in the binding free energy estimates were the major factors behind the success of the method. Lack of sufficient time and computing resources to investigate additional protonation states of the ligands was a major cause of mispredictions. The experiment demonstrated the applicability of binding free energy modeling to improve hit rates in challenging virtual screening of focused ligand libraries during lead optimization.},

Pose prediction was also quite challenging, in part because inhibitors in the set bind to three different sites, so even identifying the correct binding site was challenging. Still, the best methods managed low root mean squared deviation predictions in many cases.

Our method is based on extensive work measurement between thermodynamic states to calculate the free energy difference and it is also the same as the traditional free energy perturbation. There are important requirements for accurate calculations. The first is a well-equilibrated bound structure including the conformational change of the protein induced by the binding of the ligand. The second requirement is the convergence of the work distribution with a sufficient number of trajectories and dense spacing of the coupling constant between the ligand and the rest of the system.

  abstract = {The absolute (standard) binding free energy of eight FK506-related ligands to FKBP12 is calculated using free energy perturbation molecular dynamics (FEP/MD) simulations with explicit solvent. A number of features are implemented to improve the accuracy and enhance the convergence of the calculations. First, the absolute binding free energy is decomposed into sequential steps during which the ligand-surrounding interactions as well as various biasing potentials restraining the translation, orientation, and conformation of the ligand are turned ``on'' and ``off.'' Second, sampling of the ligand conformation is enforced by a restraining potential based on the root mean-square deviation relative to the bound state conformation. The effect of all the restraining potentials is rigorously unbiased, and it is shown explicitly that the final results are independent of all artificial restraints. Third, the repulsive and dispersive free energy contribution arising from the Lennard-Jones interactions of the ligand with its surrounding (protein and solvent) is calculated using the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen separation. This separation also improves convergence of the FEP/MD calculations. Fourth, to decrease the computational cost, only a small number of atoms in the vicinity of the binding site are simulated explicitly, while all the influence of the remaining atoms is incorporated implicitly using the generalized solvent boundary potential (GSBP) method. With GSBP, the size of the simulated FKBP12/ligand systems is significantly reduced, from $\sim$25,000 to 2500. The computations are very efficient and the statistical error is small ($\sim$1 kcal/mol). The calculated binding free energies are generally in good agreement with available experimental data and previous calculations (within $\sim$2 kcal/mol). The present results indicate that a strategy based on FEP/MD simulations of a reduced GSBP atomic model sampled with conformational, translational, and orientational restraining potentials can be computationally inexpensive and accurate.},

The results of this approach agree well with experimentally observed binding affinities. Also assessed is a commonly used approximate endpoint approach, which separately estimates enthalpy, solvation free energy, and entropy.

Structure-activity studies reveal that, in general, secondary amides are weak inhibitors of both influenza A and B viral sialidases. However, tertiary amides, which contain one or more small alkyl groups, show much greater inhibitory activity, particularly against the influenza A virus enzyme. The sialidase inhibitory activities of these compounds correlate well with their in vitro antiviral efficacy, and several of the most potent analogues displayed useful antiviral activity in vivo when evaluated in a mouse model of influenza A virus infection. Carboxamides which were highly active sialidase inhibitors in vitro also showed good antiviral activity in the mouse efficacy model of influenza A infection when administered intranasally but displayed modest activity when delivered by the intraperitoneal route.},

The methodology is tested by calculation of the relative binding free energies of a set of inhibitors of neuraminidase, cyclooxygenase2, and cyclin-dependent kinase 2. The calculated free energies are compared to the results obtained with explicit solvent simulations and empirical scoring functions. For cyclooxygenase2, deficiencies in the continuum electrostatics theory are identified and corrected with a modified simulation protocol. For neuraminidase, it is shown that a continuum representation of the solvent leads to markedly different protein-ligand interactions compared to the explicit solvent simulations, and a reconciliation of the two protocols is problematic. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 proves more challenging, and none of the methods employed in this study yield high quality predictions. Despite the differences observed, for these systems, the use of an implicit solvent framework to predict the ranking of congeneric inhibitors to a protein is shown to be faster, as accurate or more accurate than the explicit solvent protocol, and superior to empirical scoring schemes.},

The rise of resistance mutations against current antiviral therapies has increased the need for the development of novel inhibitors. Recent efforts have targeted a cavity adjacent to the catalytic site (the 150-cavity) in addition to the primary catalytic subsite in order to increase specificity and reduce the likelihood of resistance. This study details structural and in vitro analyses of a class of inhibitors that bind uniquely in both subsites. Crystal structures of three inhibitors show occupation of the 150-cavity in two distinct and novel binding modes. We believe these are the first nanomolar inhibitors of NA to be characterized in this way. Furthermore, we show that one inhibitor, binding within the catalytic site, offers reduced susceptibility to known resistance mutations via increased flexibility of a pendant pentyloxy group and the ability to pivot about a strong hydrogen-bonding network.},

Here, we perform free-energy calculations for three different ligands binding to OppA, using a thermodynamic integration approach. The tripeptide ligands share a high structural similarity (all have the sequence KXK), but their experimentally-determined binding free energies differ remarkably. Thermodynamic cycles were constructed for the ligands, and simulations conducted in the bound and (freely solvated) unbound states. In the unbound state, it was observed that the difference in conformational freedom between alanine and glycine leads to a surprisingly slow convergence, despite their chemical similarity. This could be overcome by increasing the softness parameter during alchemical transformations. Discrepancies remained in the bound state however, when comparing independent simulations of the three ligands. These difficulties could be traced to a slow relaxation of the water network within the active site. Fluctuations in the number of water molecules residing in the binding cavity occur mostly on a timescale larger than the simulation time along the alchemical path. After extensive simulations, relative binding free energies that were converged to within thermal noise could be obtained, which agree well with available experimental data.},

It is therefore an ideal system for studying how different chemical groups can be accommodated in a protein interior. The ability of the protein to bind peptides of different lengths has been studied by co-crystallising it with different ligands.

Results Crystals of OppA from Salmonella typhimurium complexed with the peptides Lys\textendash{}Lys\textendash{}Lys (KKK) and Lys\textendash{}Lys\textendash{}Lys\textendash{}Ala (KKKA) have been grown in the presence of uranyl ions which form important crystal contacts. These structures have been refined to 1.4 {\aa} and 2.1 {\aa}, respectively. The ligands are completely enclosed, their side chains pointing into large hydrated cavities and making few strong interactions with the protein.

Conclusion Tight peptide binding by OppA arises from strong hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions between the protein and the main chain of the ligand. Different basic side chains on the protein form salt bridges with the C terminus of peptide ligands of different lengths.},

We have studied the binding of eight closely related tripeptides of the type Lysine-X-Lysine, where X is an abnormal amino acid, by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and X-ray crystallography. The tripeptides fall into three series of ligands, which have been designed to examine the effects of small changes to the central side chain. Three ligands have a primary amine as the second side chain, two have a straight alkane chain, and three have ring systems. The results have revealed a definite preference for the binding of hydrophobic residues over the positively charged side chains, the latter binding only weakly due to unfavorable enthalpic effects. Within the series of positively charged groups, a point of lowest affinity has been identified and this is proposed to arise from unfavorable electrostatic interactions in the pocket, including the disruption of a key salt bridge. Marked entropy-enthalpy compensation is found across the series, and some of the difficulties in designing tightly binding ligands have been highlighted.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in improved force fields and sampling methods have made it possible for the accurate calculation of protein\textendash{}ligand binding free energies. Alchemical free energy perturbation (FEP) using an explicit solvent model is one of the most rigorous methods to calculate relative binding free energies. However, for cases where there are high energy barriers separating the relevant conformations that are important for ligand binding, the calculated free energy may depend on the initial conformation used in the simulation due to the lack of complete sampling of all the important regions in phase space. This is particularly true for ligands with multiple possible binding modes separated by high energy barriers, making it difficult to sample all relevant binding modes even with modern enhanced sampling methods. In this paper, we apply a previously developed method that provides a corrected binding free energy for ligands with multiple binding modes by combining the free energy results from multiple alchemical FEP calculations starting from all enumerated poses, and the results are compared with Glide docking and MM-GBSA calculations. From these calculations, the dominant ligand binding mode can also be predicted. We apply this method to a series of ligands that bind to c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 (JNK1) and obtain improved free energy results. The dominant ligand binding modes predicted by this method agree with the available crystallography, while both Glide docking and MM-GBSA calculations incorrectly predict the binding modes for some ligands. The method also helps separate the force field error from the ligand sampling error, such that deviations in the predicted binding free energy from the experimental values likely indicate possible inaccuracies in the force field. An error in the force field for a subset of the ligands studied was identified using this method, and improved free energy results were obtained by correcting the partial charges assigned to the ligands. This improved the root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the predicted binding free energy from 1.9 kcal/mol with the original partial charges to 1.3 kcal/mol with the corrected partial charges.},

We applied molecular dynamics simulations to study the forces and mechanical stresses associated with forced dissociation of aqueous cucurbituril\textendash{}guest complexes with high binding affinities. First, the unbinding transitions were modeled with constant velocity pulling (steered dynamics) and a soft spring constant, to model atomic force microscopy experiments. The computed length\textendash{}force profiles yield rupture forces in good agreement with available measurements. We also used steered dynamics with high spring constants to generate paths characterized by a tight control over the specified pulling distance; these paths were then equilibrated via umbrella sampling simulations and used to compute time-averaged mechanical stresses along the dissociation pathways. The stress calculations proved to be informative regarding the key interactions determining the length\textendash{}force profiles and rupture forces. In particular, the unbinding transition of one complex is found to be a stepwise process, which is initially dominated by electrostatic interactions between the guest's ammoniums and the host's carbonyl groups and subsequently limited by the extraction of the guest's bulky bicyclooctane moiety; the latter step requires some bond stretching at the cucurbituril's extraction portal. Conversely, the dissociation of a second complex with a more slender guest is mainly driven by successive electrostatic interactions between the different guest's ammoniums and the host's carbonyl groups. The calculations also provide information on the origins of thermodynamic irreversibilities in these forced dissociation processes.},

  abstract = {This article addresses calculations of the standard free energy of binding from molecular simulations in which a bound ligand is extracted from its binding site by steered molecular dynamics (MD) simulations or equilibrium umbrella sampling (US). Host\textendash{}guest systems are used as test beds to examine the requirements for obtaining the reversible work of ligand extraction. We find that, for both steered MD and US, marked irreversibilities can occur when the guest molecule crosses an energy barrier and suddenly jumps to a new position, causing dissipation of energy stored in the stretched molecule(s). For flexible molecules, this occurs even when a stiff pulling spring is used, and it is difficult to suppress in calculations where the spring is attached to the molecules by single, fixed attachment points. We, therefore, introduce and test a method, fluctuation-guided pulling, which adaptively adjusts the spring's attachment points based on the guest's atomic fluctuations relative to the host. This adaptive approach is found to substantially improve the reversibility of both steered MD and US calculations for the present systems. The results are then used to estimate standard binding free energies within a comprehensive framework, termed attach-pull-release, which recognizes that the standard free energy of binding must include not only the pulling work itself, but also the work of attaching and then releasing the spring, where the release work includes an accounting of the standard concentration to which the ligand is discharged. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This has contributed to uncertainty and controversy in certain areas. This article therefore reviews and extends the connections of some important computational methods with the underlying statistical thermodynamics. A derivation of the standard free energy of binding forms the basis of this review. This derivation should be useful in formulating novel computational methods for predicting binding affinities. It also permits several important points to be established. For example, it is found that the double-annihilation method of computing binding energy does not yield the standard free energy of binding, but can be modified to yield this quantity. The derivation also makes it possible to define clearly the changes in translational, rotational, configurational, and solvent entropy upon binding. It is argued that molecular mass has a negligible effect upon the standard free energy of binding for biomolecular systems, and that the cratic entropy defined by Gurney is not a useful concept. In addition, the use of continuum models of the solvent in binding calculations is reviewed, and a formalism is presented for incorporating a limited number of solvent molecules explicitly.},

It is observed that the potency changes induced by most chemical groups follows a nearly normal distribution centered near zero (i.e., no effect on potency). However, the widths of the distributions vary significantly between different substituents, and these effects cannot be rationalized by simple physicochemical parameters. In addition, certain substituents consistently bias the distribution toward higher or lower potency, suggesting the existence of preferred and nonpreferred chemical groups for lead optimization. The implications of these results for understanding protein\textendash{}ligand recognition and for enhancing the efficiency and speed of lead optimization will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Methods to compute free energy differences between different states of a molecular system are reviewed with the aim of identifying their basic ingredients and their utility when applied in practice to biomolecular systems. A free energy calculation is comprised of three basic components: (i) a suitable model or Hamiltonian, (ii) a sampling protocol with which one can generate a representative ensemble of molecular configurations, and (iii) an estimator of the free energy difference itself. Alternative sampling protocols can be distinguished according to whether one or more states are to be sampled. In cases where only a single state is considered, six alternative techniques could be distinguished: (i) changing the dynamics, (ii) deforming the energy surface, (iii) extending the dimensionality, (iv) perturbing the forces, (v) reducing the number of degrees of freedom, and (vi) multi-copy approaches. In cases where multiple states are to be sampled, the three primary techniques are staging, importance sampling, and adiabatic decoupling. Estimators of the free energy can be classified as global methods that either count the number of times a given state is sampled or use energy differences. Or, they can be classified as local methods that either make use of the force or are based on transition probabilities. Finally, this overview of the available techniques and how they can be best used in a practical context is aimed at helping the reader choose the most appropriate combination of approaches for the biomolecular system, Hamiltonian and free energy difference of interest. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Traditional free energy calculation methods are well-known for their drawbacks in scalability and speed in converging results particularly for calculations with large perturbations. In the present work, we report on the development of biasing potential replica exchange multisite $\lambda$-dynamics (BP-REX MS$\lambda$D), which is a free energy method that is capable of performing simultaneous alchemical free energy transformations, including perturbations between flexible moieties. BP-REX MS$\lambda$D and the original MS$\lambda$D are applied to a series of symmetrical 2,5-benzoquinone derivatives covering a diverse chemical space and range of conformational flexibility. Improved $\lambda$-space sampling is observed for the BP-REX MS$\lambda$D simulations, yielding a 2\textendash{}5-fold increase in the number of transitions between substituents compared to traditional MS$\lambda$D. We also demonstrate the efficacy of varying the value of c, the parameter that controls the ruggedness of the landscape mediating the sampling of $\lambda$-states, based on the flexibility of the fragment. Finally, we developed a protocol for maximizing the transition frequency between fragments. This protocol reduces the ``kinetic barrier'' for alchemically transforming fragments by grouping and ordering based on volume. These findings are applied to a challenging test set involving a series of geldanamycin-based inhibitors of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Even though the perturbations span volume changes by as large as 60 {\AA}3, the values for the free energy change achieve an average unsigned error (AUE) of 1.5 kcal/mol relative to experimental Kd measurements with a reasonable correlation (R = 0.56). Our results suggest that the BP-REX MS$\lambda$D algorithm is a highly efficient and scalable free energy method, which when utilized will enable routine calculations on the order of hundreds of compounds using only a few simulations.},

  abstract = {To overcome the pseudoergodicity problem, conformational sampling can be accelerated via generalized ensemble methods, e.g., through the realization of random walks along prechosen collective variables, such as spatial order parameters, energy scaling parameters, or even system temperatures or pressures, etc. As usually observed, in generalized ensemble simulations, hidden barriers are likely to exist in the space perpendicular to the collective variable direction and these residual free energy barriers could greatly abolish the sampling efficiency. This sampling issue is particularly severe when the collective variable is defined in a low-dimension subset of the target system; then the ``Hamiltonian lagging'' problem, which reveals the fact that necessary structural relaxation falls behind the move of the collective variable, may be likely to occur. To overcome this problem in equilibrium conformational sampling, we adopted the orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) strategy, which was originally developed in the context of free energy simulation [L. Zheng, M. Chen, and W. Yang, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.105, 20227 (2008)]. Thereby, generalized ensemble simulations can simultaneously escape both the explicit barriers along the collective variable direction and the hidden barriers that are strongly coupled with the collective variable move. As demonstrated in our model studies, the present OSRW based generalized ensemble treatments show improved sampling capability over the corresponding classical generalized ensemble treatments.},

  abstract = {A general methodology for calculating the equilibrium binding constant of a flexible ligand to a protein receptor is formulated on the basis of potentials of mean force. The overall process is decomposed into several stages that can be computed separately: the free ligand in the bulk is first restrained into the conformation it adopts in the bound state, position, and orientation by applying biasing potentials, then it is translated into the binding site, where it is released completely. The conformational restraining potential is based on the root-mean-square deviation of the peptide coordinates relative to its average conformation in the bound complex. Free energy contributions from each stage are calculated by means of free energy perturbation potential of mean force techniques by using appropriate order parameters. The present approach avoids the need to decouple the ligand from its surrounding (bulk solvent and receptor protein) as is traditionally performed in the double-decoupling scheme. It is believed that the present formulation will be particularly useful when the solvation free energy of the ligand is very large. As an application, the equilibrium binding constant of the phosphotyrosine peptide pYEEI to the Src homology 2 domain of human Lck has been calculated. The results are in good agreement with experimental values.},

Applying path-sampling methods for this purpose involves calculating the associated potential of mean force (PMF) and gives insight into the binding free energy along the binding process. Without a priori knowledge about the binding path, sampling reversible binding can be difficult to achieve. To alleviate this problem, we introduce the distancefield (DF) as a reaction coordinate for such calculations. DF is a grid-based method in which the shortest distance between the binding site and a ligand is determined avoiding routes that pass through the protein. Combining this reaction coordinate with Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics (HREMD) allows for the reversible binding of the ligand to the protein. A comparison is made between umbrella sampling using regular distance restraints and HREMD with DF restraints to study aspirin binding to the protein phospholipase A2. Although the free energies of binding are similar for both methods, the increased sampling with HREMD has a significant influence on the shape of the PMF. A remarkable agreement between the calculated binding free energies from the PMF and the experimental estimate is obtained.},

@article{calabro_accelerating_2015,
  title = {Accelerating Molecular Simulations Implication for Rational Drug Design},
  abstract = {The development and approval of new drugs is an expensive process. The total
cost for the approval of a new compound is on average 1.0 - 1.2 billion dollars and
the entire process lasts about 12 - 15 years. The main difficulties are related to
poor pharmacokinetics, lack of efficacy and unwanted side effects. These problems
have naturally led to the question if new and alternative methodologies can be
developed to find reliable and low cost alternatives to existing practices.
Nowadays, computer-assisted tools are used to support the decision process
along the early stages of the drug discovery path leading from the identification
of a suitable biomolecular target to the design/optimization of drug-like
molecules. This process includes assessments about target druggability, screening
of molecular libraries and the optimization of lead compounds where new drug-like
molecules able to bind with sufficiently affinity and specificity to a disease-involved
protein are designed. Existing computational methods used by the pharmaceutical
industry are usually focused on the screening of library compounds such as
docking, chemoinformatics and other ligand-based methods to predict and improve
binding affinities, but their reliable application requires improvements in
accuracy.
New quantitative methods based on molecular simulations of drug binding
to a protein could greatly improve prospects for the reliable in-silico design of
new potent drug candidates. A common parameter used by medicinal chemists to
quantify the affinity between candidate ligands and a target protein is represented
by the free energy of binding. However, despite the increased amount of structural
information, predicting binding free energy is still a challenge and this technique
has found limited use beyond academia. A major reason for limited adoption in
the industry is that reliable computer models of drug binding to a protein must
reproduce the change in molecular conformations of the drug and protein upon
complex formation and this includes the correct modelling of weak non-covalent
interactions such as hydrogen bonds, burials of hydrophobic surface areas, Van der
Waals interactions, fixations of molecular degrees of freedom solvation/desolvation
of polar groups and different entropy contributions related to the solvent and
protein interactions. For several classes of proteins these phenomena are not easy
to model and often require extremely computationally intensive simulations.
The main goal of the thesis was to explore efficient ways of computing binding
affinities by using molecular simulations. With this aim, novel software to compute
relative binding free energies has been developed. The implementation is based on
alchemical transformations and it extended a preexisted piece of software Sire, a
molecular modeling framework, by using the OpenMM APIs to run fast molecular
dynamics simulations on the latest GPGPU technology. This new piece of software
has equipped the scientific community with a flexible and fast tool, not only
to predict relative binding affinities, but also a starting point to develop new
sampling methods for instance hybrid molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo. The
implementation has been validated on the prediction of relative hydration free
energy of small molecules, showing good agreement with experimental data. In
addition, non-additive effects to binding affinities in series of congeneric Thrombin
inhibitors were investigated. Although excellent agreement between predicted
and experimental relative binding affinities was achieved, it was not possible to
accurately predict the non-additivity levels in most of the examined inhibitors,
thus suggesting that improved force fields are required to further advance the
state-of-the art of the field.},

Non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase are an important component of treatment against HIV infection. Novel inhibitors are sought that increase potency against variants that contain the Tyr181Cys mutation.
Methods
Molecular dynamics based free energy perturbation simulations have been run to study factors that contribute to protein\textendash{}ligand binding, and the results are compared with those from previous Monte Carlo based simulations and activity data.
Results
Predictions of protein\textendash{}ligand binding modes are very consistent for the two simulation methods; the accord is attributed to the use of an enhanced sampling protocol. The Tyr181Cys binding pocket supports large, hydrophobic substituents, which is in good agreement with experiment.
Conclusions
Although some discrepancies exist between the results of the two simulation methods and experiment, free energy perturbation simulations can be used to rapidly test small molecules for gains in binding affinity.
General significance
Free energy perturbation methods show promise in providing fast, reliable and accurate data that can be used to complement experiment in lead optimization projects. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled ``Recent developments of molecular dynamics''.},

  abstract = {The identification of lead molecules using computational modeling often relies on approximate, high-throughput approaches, of limited accuracy. We show here that, with a methodology we recently developed, it is possible to predict the relative binding free energies of structurally diverse ligands of the estrogen receptor-$\alpha$ using a rigorous statistical thermodynamics approach. Predictions obtained from the simulations with an explicit solvation model are in good qualitative agreement with experimental data, while simulations with implicit solvent models or rank ordering by empirical scoring functions yield predictions of lower quality. In addition, it is shown that free energy techniques can be used to select the most likely binding mode from a set of possible orientations generated by a docking program. It is suggested that the free energy techniques outlined in this study can be used to rank-order, by potency, structurally diverse compounds identified by virtual screening, de novo design or scaffold hopping programs.},

The Community Structure Activity Resource (CSAR) aims to collect available data from industry and academia which may be used for this purpose ( www.csardock.org ). Also, CSAR is charged with organizing community-wide exercises based on the collected data. The first of these exercises was aimed to gauge the overall state of docking and scoring, using a large and diverse data set of protein?ligand complexes. Participants were asked to calculate the affinity of the complexes as provided and then recalculate with changes which may improve their specific method. This first data set was selected from existing PDB entries which had binding data (Kd or Ki) in Binding MOAD, augmented with entries from PDBbind. The final data set contains 343 diverse protein?ligand complexes and spans 14 pKd. Sixteen proteins have three or more complexes in the data set, from which a user could start an inspection of congeneric series. Inherent experimental error limits the possible correlation between scores and measured affinity; R2 is limited to ?0.9 when fitting to the data set without over parametrizing. R2 is limited to ?0.8 when scoring the data set with a method trained on outside data. The details of how the data set was initially selected, and the process by which it matured to better fit the needs of the community are presented. Many groups generously participated in improving the data set, and this underscores the value of a supportive, collaborative effort in moving our field forward.},

For a nominal familywise error rate of 5\%, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference. These findings speak to the need of validating the statistical methods being used in the field of neuroimaging.},

The relative differences of the thermodynamic parameters of complexation revealed the existence of specific interactions between urea and the aromatic surfaces of some of the nonpolar guests. As expected, the relative changes in the complex stability constants upon addition of urea have been found to depend on the balance of opposing enthalpic and entropic contributions. The interpretation as well as the magnitude of the interaction between urea and aromatic surfaces are in line with previous experimental and computational studies. The experimental evidence presented in this work provides insight into the mechanism by which large amounts of urea denature globular proteins in aqueous media.},

  abstract = {The ability to computationally predict protein-small molecule binding affinities with high accuracy would accelerate drug discovery and reduce its cost by eliminating rounds of trial-and-error synthesis and experimental evaluation of candidate ligands. As academic and industrial groups work toward this capability, there is an ongoing need for datasets that can be used to rigorously test new computational methods. Although protein\textendash{}ligand data are clearly important for this purpose, their size and complexity make it difficult to obtain well-converged results and to troubleshoot computational methods. Host\textendash{}guest systems offer a valuable alternative class of test cases, as they exemplify noncovalent molecular recognition but are far smaller and simpler. As a consequence, host\textendash{}guest systems have been part of the prior two rounds of SAMPL prediction exercises, and they also figure in the present SAMPL5 round. In addition to being blinded, and thus avoiding biases that may arise in retrospective studies, the SAMPL challenges have the merit of focusing multiple researchers on a common set of molecular systems, so that methods may be compared and ideas exchanged. The present paper provides an overview of the host\textendash{}guest component of SAMPL5, which centers on three different hosts, two octa-acids and a glycoluril-based molecular clip, and two different sets of guest molecules, in aqueous solution. A range of methods were applied, including electronic structure calculations with implicit solvent models; methods that combine empirical force fields with implicit solvent models; and explicit solvent free energy simulations. The most reliable methods tend to fall in the latter class, consistent with results in prior SAMPL rounds, but the level of accuracy is still below that sought for reliable computer-aided drug design. Advances in force field accuracy, modeling of protonation equilibria, electronic structure methods, and solvent models, hold promise for future improvements.},

  abstract = {In the recent SAMPL5 challenge, participants submitted predictions for cyclohexane/water distribution coefficients for a set of 53 small molecules. Distribution coefficients (log D) replace the hydration free energies that were a central part of the past five SAMPL challenges. A wide variety of computational methods were represented by the 76 submissions from 18 participating groups. Here, we analyze submissions by a variety of error metrics and provide details for a number of reference calculations we performed. As in the SAMPL4 challenge, we assessed the ability of participants to evaluate not just their statistical uncertainty, but their model uncertainty\textemdash{}how well they can predict the magnitude of their model or force field error for specific predictions. Unfortunately, this remains an area where prediction and analysis need improvement. In SAMPL4 the top performing submissions achieved a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) around 1.5 kcal/mol. If we anticipate accuracy in log D predictions to be similar to the hydration free energy predictions in SAMPL4, the expected error here would be around 1.54 log units. Only a few submissions had an RMSE below 2.5 log units in their predicted log D values. However, distribution coefficients introduced complexities not present in past SAMPL challenges, including tautomer enumeration, that are likely to be important in predicting biomolecular properties of interest to drug discovery, therefore some decrease in accuracy would be expected. Overall, the SAMPL5 distribution coefficient challenge provided great insight into the importance of modeling a variety of physical effects. We believe these types of measurements will be a promising source of data for future blind challenges, especially in view of the relatively straightforward nature of the experiments and the level of insight provided.},

  abstract = {The Drug Design Data Resource (D3R) ran Grand Challenge 2015 between September 2015 and February 2016. Two targets served as the framework to test community docking and scoring methods: (1) HSP90, donated by AbbVie and the Community Structure Activity Resource (CSAR), and (2) MAP4K4, donated by Genentech. The challenges for both target datasets were conducted in two stages, with the first stage testing pose predictions and the capacity to rank compounds by affinity with minimal structural data; and the second stage testing methods for ranking compounds with knowledge of at least a subset of the ligand\textendash{}protein poses. An additional sub-challenge provided small groups of chemically similar HSP90 compounds amenable to alchemical calculations of relative binding free energy. Unlike previous blinded Challenges, we did not provide cognate receptors or receptors prepared with hydrogens and likewise did not require a specified crystal structure to be used for pose or affinity prediction in Stage 1. Given the freedom to select from over 200 crystal structures of HSP90 in the PDB, participants employed workflows that tested not only core docking and scoring technologies, but also methods for addressing water-mediated ligand\textendash{}protein interactions, binding pocket flexibility, and the optimal selection of protein structures for use in docking calculations. Nearly 40 participating groups submitted over 350 prediction sets for Grand Challenge 2015. This overview describes the datasets and the organization of the challenge components, summarizes the results across all submitted predictions, and considers broad conclusions that may be drawn from this collaborative community endeavor.},

  abstract = {The factors affecting host-guest complexation between the molecular container compound cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) and various guests in aqueous solution are studied, and a detailed complexation mechanism in the presence of cations is derived. The formation of the supramolecular complex is studied in detail for cyclohexylmethylammonium ion as guest. The kinetics and thermodynamics of complexation is monitored by NMR as a function of temperature, salt concentration, and cation size. The binding constants and the ingression rate constants decrease with increasing salt concentration and cation-binding constant, in agreement with a competitive binding of the ammonium site of the guest and the metal cation with the ureido carbonyl portals of CB6. Studies as a function of guest size indicate that the effective container volume of the CB6 cavity is approximately 105 {\AA}3. It is suggested that larger guests are excluded for two reasons:\, a high activation barrier for ingression imposed by the tight CB6 portals and a destabilization of the complex due to steric repulsion inside. For example, in the case of the nearly spherical azoalkane homologues 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (DBH, volume ca. 96 {\AA}3) and 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene (DBO, volume ca. 110 {\AA}3), the former forms the CB6 complex promptly with a sizable binding constant (1300 M-1), while the latter does not form a complex even after several months at optimized complexation conditions. Molecular mechanics calculations are performed for several CB6/guest complexes. A qualitative agreement is found between experimental and calculated activation energies for ingression as a function of both guest size and state of protonation. The potential role of constrictive binding by CB6 is discussed.},

  abstract = {The activated state of cytochrome c peroxidase, compound ES, contains a cation radical on the Trp-191 side chain. We recently reported that replacing this tryptophan with glycine creates a buried cavity at the active site that contains ordered solvent and that will specifically bind substituted imidazoles in their protonated cationic forms (Fitzgerald MM, Churchill MJ, McRee DE, Goodin DB, 1994, Biochemistry 55:3807\textendash{}3818). Proposals that a nearby carboxylate, Asp-235, and competing monovalent cations should modulate the affinity of the W191G cavity for ligand binding are addressed in this study. Competitive binding titrations of the imidazolium ion to W191G as a function of [K+] show that potassium competes weakly with the binding of imidazoles. The dissociation constant observed for potassium binding (18 mM) is more than 3, 000-fold higher than that for 1, 2-dimethylimidazole (5.5 $\mu$M) in the absence of competing cations. Significantly, the W191G-D235N double mutant shows no evidence for binding imidazoles in their cationic or neutral forms, even though the structure of the cavity remains largely unperturbed by replacement of the carboxylate. Refined crystallographic 5-values of solvent positions indicate that the weakly bound potassium in W191G is significantly depopulated in the double mutant. These results demonstrate that the buried negative charge of Asp-235 is an essential feature of the cation binding determinant and indicate that this carboxylate plays a critical role in stabilizing the formation of the Trp-191 radical cation.},

In a series of congeneric ligands, surprising changes of protonation states occur and are overlaid on the binding process. They result from induced pKa shifts depending on the local environment experienced by the ligand and protein functional groups in the complex (induced dielectric fit). They involve additional heat effects that must be corrected before any conclusion on the binding enthalpy ($\Delta$H) and entropy ($\Delta$S) can be drawn. After correction, trends in both contributions can be interpreted in structural terms with respect to the hydrogen bond inventory or residual ligand motions. For all inhibitors studied, a strong negative heat capacity change ($\Delta$Cp) is detected, thus binding becomes more exothermic and entropically less favourable with increasing temperature. Due to a mutual compensation, Gibbs free energy remains virtually unchanged. The strong negative $\Delta$Cp value cannot solely be explained by the removal of hydrophobic surface portions of the protein or ligand from water exposure. Additional contributions must be considered, presumably arising from modulations of the local water structure, changes in vibrational modes or other ordering parameters. For thrombin, smaller negative $\Delta$Cp values are observed for ligand binding in the presence of sodium ions compared to the other alkali ions, probably due to stabilising effects on the protein or changes in the bound water structure.},

So far, successful efforts have been limited to chromatin modifying enzymes, or so-called epigenetic `writers' and `erasers'. Potent inhibitors of histone binding modules have not yet been described. Here we report a cell-permeable small molecule (JQ1) that binds competitively to acetyl-lysine recognition motifs, or bromodomains. High potency and specificity towards a subset of human bromodomains is explained by co-crystal structures with bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family member BRD4, revealing excellent shape complementarity with the acetyl-lysine binding cavity. Recurrent translocation of BRD4 is observed in a genetically-defined, incurable subtype of human squamous carcinoma. Competitive binding by JQ1 displaces the BRD4 fusion oncoprotein from chromatin, prompting squamous differentiation and specific antiproliferative effects in BRD4-dependent cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. These data establish proof-of-concept for targeting protein\textendash{}protein interactions of epigenetic `readers', and provide a versatile chemical scaffold for the development of chemical probes more broadly throughout the bromodomain family.},

An integral part of this mechanism occurs through lysine acetylation of histone tails which are recognized by bromodomains. While the biological and structural characterization of many bromodomain containing proteins has advanced considerably, the therapeutic tractability of this protein family is only now becoming understood. This paper describes the discovery and molecular characterization of potent (nM) small molecule inhibitors that disrupt the function of the BET family of bromodomains (Brd2, Brd3, and Brd4). By using a combination of phenotypic screening, chemoproteomics, and biophysical studies, we have discovered that the protein\textendash{}protein interactions between bromodomains and acetylated histones can be antagonized by selective small molecules that bind at the acetylated lysine recognition pocket. X-ray crystal structures of compounds bound into bromodomains of Brd2 and Brd4 elucidate the molecular interactions of binding and explain the precisely defined stereochemistry required for activity.},

These acetyl-lysine (KAc) ``reader'' domains are part of the write\textendash{}read\textendash{}erase concept that has been linked with the transfer of epigenetic information. By reading KAc marks on histones, bromodomains mediate protein\textendash{}protein interactions between a diverse array of partners. There has been intense activity in developing potent and selective small molecule probes that disrupt the interaction between a given bromodomain and KAc. Rapid success has been achieved with the BET family of bromodomains, and a number of potent and selective probes have been reported. These compounds have enabled linking of the BET bromodomains with diseases, including cancer and inflammation, suggesting that bromodomains are druggable targets. Herein, we review the biology of the bromodomains and discuss the SAR for the existing small molecule probes. The biology that has been enabled by these compounds is summarized.},

Our current knowledge of the functional differences of the two bromodomains of BRD4, however, is limited and is hindered by the lack of selective inhibitors. Here, we report our structure-guided development of diazobenzene-based small-molecule inhibitors for the BRD4 bromodomains that have over 90\% sequence identity at the acetyl-lysine binding site. Our lead compound, MS436, through a set of water-mediated interactions, exhibits low nanomolar affinity (estimated Ki of 30\textendash{}50 nM), with preference for the first bromodomain over the second. We demonstrated that MS436 effectively inhibits BRD4 activity in NF-$\kappa$B-directed production of nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 in murine macrophages.

  abstract = {Since the $\beta$-cyclodextrin cavity is not a smooth cone but has constrictions in the neighborhoods of the H3 and H5 atoms, the hypothesis that bulky hydrophobic guests can form two isomeric inclusion complexes (one of them, cp, is formed by the entrance of the guest by the primary side of the cavity, and the other one, cs, results from the entrance by the secondary side) is checked. Thus, the inclusion processes of two 1-substituted adamantyl derivatives (rimantidine and adamantylmethanol) with $\beta$-cyclodextrin and its two monoamino derivatives at positions 6 (6-NH2$\beta$-CD) and 3 (3-NH2$\beta$-CD) were studied. From rotating-frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy experiments, it was deduced that both guests form cs complexes with $\beta$-CD and 6-NH2$\beta$-CD but cp complexes with 3-NH2$\beta$-CD. In all cases, the hydrophilic group attached to the adamantyl residue protrudes toward the bulk solvent outside the cyclodextrin cavity. The thermodynamic parameters (free energy, equilibrium constant, enthalpy, and entropy) associated with the inclusion phenomena were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry experiments. From these results, the difference in the free energy for the formation of the two complexes, cs and cp, for the same host/guest system has been estimated as being 11.5 $\pm$ 0.8 kJ mol-1. This large difference explains why under normal experimental conditions only one of the two complexes (cs) is detected. It is also concluded that a hyperboloid of revolution can be a better schematic picture to represent the actual geometry of the cyclodextrin cavities than the usual smooth cone or trapezium.},

  abstract = {Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to characterize inclusion complex formation of natural cyclodextrins ($\alpha$- and $\beta$-cyclodextrin) with three drugs ((+)brompheniramine, ($\pm$)brompheniramine, cyclopentolate) in aqueous solutions. ITC measurements were carried out at 298.15 K on a Microcal OMEGA ultrasensitive titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc.). The experimental data were analyzed on the basis of the model of a single set of identical sites (ITC tutorial guide). $\beta$-CD forms inclusion complexes of stoichiometry 1:1 with the all investigated drugs. In turn, smaller molecule of $\alpha$-CD forms inclusion complexes of two different stoichiometry: with bigger molecules ((+)brompheniramine and ($\pm$)brompheniramine) of a stoichiometry 2:1 and with smaller molecules (cyclopentolate) of a stoichiometry 1:2. Based on the experimental values of equilibrium constant (K) and enthalpy of complex formation ($\Delta$H), the Gibbs energy of complex formation ($\Delta$G), and the entropy of complex formation ($\Delta$S), have been calculated, for all the investigated systems. Obtained results showed that complex formation of $\beta$-CD (bigger molecule with wider cavity compared to $\beta$-CD) with both (+)brompheniramine, ($\pm$)brompheniramine, and cyclopentolate is enthalpy driven while complexes of $\alpha$-CD with the all investigated drugs are enthalpy-entropy stabilized. This indicated that the difference in the cavity dimensions is reflecting in different driving forces of complex formation and binding modes what resulted in different stoichiometry of the obtained inclusion complexes.},

  doi = {10.1038/sj.bjp.0706973},
  abstract = {Background and purpose:
Neuroactive steroids are potent modulators of GABAA receptors and are thus of interest for their sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and anaesthetic properties. Cyclodextrins may be useful tools to manipulate neuroactive effects of steroids on GABAA receptors because cyclodextrins form inclusion complexes with at least some steroids that are active at the GABAA receptor, such as (3$\alpha$,5$\alpha$)-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one (3$\alpha$5$\alpha$P, allopregnanolone).
Experimental approach:
To assess the versatility of cyclodextrins as steroid modulators, we investigated interactions between $\gamma$-cyclodextrin and neuroactive steroids of different structural classes.
Key results:
Both a bioassay based on electrophysiological assessment of GABAA receptor function and optical measurements of cellular accumulation of a fluorescent steroid analogue suggest that $\gamma$-cyclodextrin sequesters steroids rather than directly influencing GABAA receptor function. Neither a 5$\beta$-reduced A/B ring fusion nor a sulphate group at carbon 3 affected the presumed inclusion complex formation between steroid and $\gamma$-cyclodextrin. Apparent dissociation constants for interactions between natural steroids and $\gamma$-cyclodexrin ranged from 10-60 $\mu$M. Although $\gamma$-cyclodextrin accommodates a range of natural and synthetic steroids, C11 substitutions reduced inclusion complex formation. Using $\gamma$-cyclodextrin to remove steroid not directly bound to GABAA receptors, we found that cellular retention of receptor-unbound steroid rate limits potentiation by 3$\alpha$- hydroxysteroids but not inhibition by sulphated steroids.
Conclusions and implications:
We conclude that $\gamma$-cyclodextrins can be useful, albeit non-specific, tools for terminating the actions of multiple classes of naturally occurring neuroactive steroids.British Journal of Pharmacology (2007) 150, 164\textendash{}175. doi:10.1038/sj.bjp.0706973},

The strongest interaction was observed at pH 1.2, at which two different 1:1 complexes can be formed depending on the hydrophobic ring of the drug involved in the process. At pH 5.8 and 7.4 the likelihood of 1:2 stoichiometry increases as a consequence of the simultaneous complexation of the nonprotonized imidazolyl and the dichlorophenyl groups. In the presence of 20\% HP-$\beta$-CD, SN solubility is enhanced by a factor of 116, 107, and 5 at pH 1.2, 5.8, and 7.4, respectively. Complexation enthalpy recorded by ITC showed the same tendency which confirms the practical interest of this technique for fast screening of the potential of CDs as drug solubilizers. Solubility and dissolution rate of the drug from compacts prepared with freeze-dried complexes were significantly greater than those obtained with SN powder or compacts made with physical blends. \textcopyright{} 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 95: 1751\textendash{}1762, 2006},

Elemental analysis, 1H NMR, MS, and Differential Scanning Calorimetry analysis were used to determine the average degree of substitution for each $\beta$-cyclodextrin derivative. The average degrees of substitution are 3.4, 1.6 and 2.5 for sulfoethyl, sulfopropyl and sulfobutyl ether $\beta$-cyclodextrin, respectively. The water solubility of these derivatives is substantially higher than that of $\beta$-cyclodextrin. 1H NMR indicates thatsulfoethyl ether $\beta$-cyclodextrin may have major substitution on the secondaryhydroxyl group while the major substitution in sulfopropyl and sulfobutyl ether$\beta$-cyclodextrin could be on the primary hydroxyl group. MS spectra showthat no more than one substitution occurred on a single glucose unit.},

The binding free energies are calculated using conventional mutation of the substrate force field from one chemical structure to another (two-state problem) in water and in the neutral inclusion complex. For calculation of activation free-energy differences between two substrates the transition states are represented by linear combinations of reactant (anionic inclusion complexes) and product (tetrahedral intermediate) force fields (four-state problem). The coefficients of this linear combination are obtained from empirical valence bond simulations of a reference substrate.

These calculations require hours to a day on a commodity computer. The calculations also indicate that the changes in configurational entropy upon binding oppose association by as much as 24 kcal/mol and result primarily from a narrowing of energy wells in the bound versus the free state, rather than from a drop in the number of distinct low-energy conformations on binding. Also, the configurational entropy is found to vary substantially among the bound conformations of a given cyclodextrin-guest complex. This result suggests that the configurational entropy must be accounted for to reliably rank docked conformations in both host-guest and ligand-protein complexes. In close analogy with the common experimental observation of entropy-enthalpy compensation, the computed entropy changes show a near-linear relationship with the changes in mean potential plus solvation energy.},

The free-energy profiles that delineate the inclusion process were determined using an adaptive biasing force. The present results reveal that although the free-energy surfaces feature two local minima corresponding to a partial and a complete inclusion, the former mode is markedly preferred, irrespective of the orientation. Ranking the propensity of the three steroidal molecules to associate with $\beta$-CD, viz. progesterone $>$ testosterone $>$ hydrocortisone, is shown to be in excellent agreement with experiment. This conclusion is further supported by independent calculations relying on alchemical transformations in conjunction with free energy perturbation, wherein the relative binding free energy for the three steroids was estimated. In addition, decomposition of the potentials of mean force into free-energy contributions and significant decrease in the total hydrophobic surface area suggest that by and large, van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions constitute the main driving forces responsible for the formation of the inclusion complexes. Analysis of their structural features from the molecular dynamics trajectories brings to light different hydrogen-bonding patterns that are characterized by distinct dynamics and stabilities.},

Due to their small size relative to much larger protein\textendash{}ligand complexes, converged results can be obtained rapidly for these systems thus offering the opportunity to more reliably study fundamental aspects of the thermodynamics of binding. In this work, we have performed a large scale binding affinity survey of 57 $\beta$-cyclodextrin (CD) host\textendash{}guest systems using the binding energy distribution analysis method (BEDAM) with implicit solvation (OPLS-AA/AGBNP2). Converged estimates of the standard binding free energies are obtained for these systems by employing techniques such as parallel Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics, conformational reservoirs, and multistate free energy estimators. Good agreement with experimental measurements is obtained in terms of both numerical accuracy and affinity rankings. Overall, average effective binding energies reproduce affinity rank ordering better than the calculated binding affinities, even though calculated binding free energies, which account for effects such as conformational strain and entropy loss upon binding, provide lower root-mean-square errors when compared to measurements. Interestingly, we find that binding free energies are superior rank order predictors for a large subset containing the most flexible guests. The results indicate that, while challenging, accurate modeling of reorganization effects can lead to ligand design models of superior predictive power for rank ordering relative to models based only on ligand\textendash{}receptor interaction energies.},

In this work, the chiral recognition ability of $\beta$-cyclodextrin to one of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ketoprofen, has been systematically investigated using molecular dynamics and free energy simulation methods. The R- and S-enantiomers of ketoprofen were explicitly bound within the cyclodextrin cavity in our simulations, respectively. In consistent with experimental observations, tiny structural difference between two isomers could be observed. Calculated absolute binding free energies using adapted biasing force (ABF) method and MM/GBSA approach for both isomers are comparable to experimental values. Significant binding fluctuations along the MD trajectory have been observed. The free energy profiles calculated using two different approaches reveal that the ketoprofen prefers binding in the cavity with the carboxylate group facing the wider edge of $\beta$-cyclodextrin. Similar free energy profiles for two enantiomers obtained using ABF calculations indicate that it is very hard to separate and identify the chiral conjugates within the framework of the natural $\beta$-cyclodextrin.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of solvation (binding) free energies with implicit solvent models in different dielectric environments for biological simulations as well as high throughput ligand screening remain challenging endeavors. In order to address how well implicit solvent models approximate explicit ones we examined four generalized Born models (GBStill, GBHCT, GBOBCI, and GBOBCII) for determining the dimerization free energy ($\Delta$G0) of $\beta$-cyclodextrin monomers in 17 implicit solvents with dielectric constants (D) ranging from 5 to 80 and compared the results to previous free energy calculations with explicit solvents (Zhang et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2012, 116, 12684-12693). The comparison indicates that neglecting the environmental dependence of Born radii appears acceptable for such calculations involving cyclodextrin and that the GBStill and GBOBCI models yield a reasonable estimation of $\Delta$G0, although the details of binding are quite different from explicit solvents. Large discrepancies between implicit and explicit solvent models occur in high-dielectric media with strong hydrogen bond (HB) interruption properties. $\Delta$G0 with the GB models is shown to correlate strongly to 2(D\textendash{}1)/(2D+1) (R2 $\sim$ 0.90) in line with the Onsager reaction field (Onsager J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1936, 58, 1486-1493) but to be very sensitive to D (D $<$ 10) as well. Both high-dielectric environments where hydrogen bonds are of interest and low-dielectric media such as protein binding pockets and membrane interiors therefore need to be considered with caution in GB-based calculations. Finally, a literature analysis of Gibbs energy of solvation of small molecules in organic liquids shows that the Onsager relation does not hold for real molecules since the correlation between $\Delta$G0 and 2(D\textendash{}1)/(2D+1) is low for most solutes. Interestingly, explicit solvent calculations of the solvation free energy (Zhang et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2015, 55, 1192-1201) reproduce the weak experimental correlations with 2(D\textendash{}1)/(2D+1) very well.},

The isolation of a defined size LR-CD is an essential prerequisite for studying their structural properties. Unfortunately the purification procedure of these substances turned out to be very laborious. Finally the problem could be circumvented by a theoretical consideration: the highly advantageous replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulation (particularly suitable for studies of conformational changes) offers an ideal approach for studying the conformational change of $\varepsilon$-cyclodextrin (CD10), a smaller representative of LR-CDs. Three carbohydrate force fields and three solvent models were tested. The conformational behavior of CD10 was analyzed in terms of the flip (turn) of the glucose subunits within the macrocyclic ring. In addition a ranking of conformations with various numbers of turns was preformed. Our findings might be also helpful in the temperature controlled synthesis of LR-CDs as well as other experimental conditions, in particular for the host\textendash{}guest reaction.},

The double decoupling approach was employed to calculate the standard binding free enthalpy of 1-hexanol, while for all other compounds relative binding free enthalpies for pairs of alcohols differing by two carbon atoms were calculated from twin-system enveloping distribution sampling simulations. While all three force fields slightly overestimate the magnitude of the standard binding free enthalpy of 1-hexanol the 53A6GLYC and 56A6CARBO\_R+ parameter sets are a little closer to the experimental data than 56A6CARBO\_R. For relative binding free enthalpies no significant difference between the force fields was observed. All three force fields support those experimental measurements that found a distinct increase in the binding affinity with increasing number of carbon atoms even for longer chain lengths up to 1-dodecanol.},

  abstract = {A new derivation of the GLYCAM06 force field, which removes its previous specificity for carbohydrates, and its dependency on the AMBER force field and parameters, is presented. All pertinent force field terms have been explicitly specified and so no default or generic parameters are employed. The new GLYCAM is no longer limited to any particular class of biomolecules, but is extendible to all molecular classes in the spirit of a small-molecule force field. The torsion terms in the present work were all derived from quantum mechanical data from a collection of minimal molecular fragments and related small molecules. For carbohydrates, there is now a single parameter set applicable to both $\alpha$- and $\beta$-anomers and to all monosaccharide ring sizes and conformations. We demonstrate that deriving dihedral parameters by fitting to QM data for internal rotational energy curves for representative small molecules generally leads to correct rotamer populations in molecular dynamics simulations, and that this approach removes the need for phase corrections in the dihedral terms. However, we note that there are cases where this approach is inadequate. Reported here are the basic components of the new force field as well as an illustration of its extension to carbohydrates. In addition to reproducing the gas-phase properties of an array of small test molecules, condensed-phase simulations employing GLYCAM06 are shown to reproduce rotamer populations for key small molecules and representative biopolymer building blocks in explicit water, as well as crystalline lattice properties, such as unit cell dimensions, and vibrational frequencies. \textcopyright{} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The present work details the development of force-field parameters for these monosaccharides and their covalent connections to proteins via O linkages to serine or threonine side chains and via N linkages to asparagine side chains. The force field development protocol was designed to explicitly yield parameters that are compatible with the existing CHARMM additive force field for proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, and small molecules. Therefore, when combined with previously developed parameters for pyranose and furanose monosaccharides, for glycosidic linkages between monosaccharides, and for proteins, the present set of parameters enables the molecular simulation of a wide variety of biologically important molecules such as complex carbohydrates and glycoproteins. Parametrization included fitting to quantum mechanical (QM) geometries and conformational energies of model compounds, as well as to QM pair interaction energies and distances of model compounds with water. Parameters were validated in the context of crystals of relevant monosaccharides, as well NMR and/or X-ray crystallographic data on larger systems including oligomeric hyaluronan, sialyl Lewis X, O- and N-linked glycopeptides, and a lectin:sucrose complex. As the validated parameters are an extension of the CHARMM all-atom additive biomolecular force field, they further broaden the types of heterogeneous systems accessible with a consistently developed force-field model.},

Advances in carbohydrate force fields and scoring functions can be largely attributed to enhanced computational algorithms, application of quantum mechanics, and the increasing number of experimental structures determined by X-ray and NMR techniques. The conformational analysis of carbohydrates is challengeable and has gone into intensive study in elucidating the anomeric, the exo-anomeric, and the gauche effects. Here, we review the issues associated with carbohydrate force fields and scoring functions, which will have a broad application in the field of carbohydrate-based drug design.},

  abstract = {It is well known that high hydrostatic pressures can induce the unfolding of proteins. The physical underpinnings of this phenomenon have been investigated extensively but remain controversial. Changes in solvation energetics have been commonly proposed as a driving force for pressure-induced unfolding. Recently, the elimination of void volumes in the native folded state has been argued to be the principal determinant. Here we use the cavity-containing L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme to examine the pressure-induced destabilization of this multidomain protein by using solution NMR spectroscopy. The cavity-containing C-terminal domain completely unfolds at moderate pressures, whereas the N-terminal domain remains largely structured to pressures as high as 2.5 kbar. The sensitivity to pressure is suppressed by the binding of benzene to the hydrophobic cavity. These results contrast to the pseudo-WT protein, which has a residual cavity volume very similar to that of the L99A\textendash{}benzene complex but shows extensive subglobal reorganizations with pressure. Encapsulation of the L99A mutant in the aqueous nanoscale core of a reverse micelle is used to examine the hydration of the hydrophobic cavity. The confined space effect of encapsulation suppresses the pressure-induced unfolding transition and allows observation of the filling of the cavity with water at elevated pressures. This indicates that hydration of the hydrophobic cavity is more energetically unfavorable than global unfolding. Overall, these observations point to a range of cooperativity and energetics within the T4 lysozyme molecule and illuminate the fact that small changes in physical parameters can significantly alter the pressure sensitivity of proteins.},

  abstract = {Application of hydrostatic pressure shifts protein conformational equilibria in a direction to reduce the volume of the system. A current view is that the volume reduction is dominated by elimination of voids or cavities in the protein interior via cavity hydration, although an alternative mechanism wherein cavities are filled with protein side chains resulting from a structure relaxation has been suggested [L{\'o}pez CJ, Yang Z, Altenbach C, Hubbell WL (2013) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110(46):E4306\textendash{}E4315]. In the present study, mechanisms for elimination of cavities under high pressure are investigated in the L99A cavity mutant of T4 lysozyme and derivatives thereof using site-directed spin labeling, pressure-resolved double electron\textendash{}electron resonance, and high-pressure circular dichroism spectroscopy. In the L99A mutant, the ground state is in equilibrium with an excited state of only $\sim$3\% of the population in which the cavity is filled by a protein side chain [Bouvignies et al. (2011) Nature 477(7362):111\textendash{}114]. The results of the present study show that in L99A the native ground state is the dominant conformation to pressures of 3 kbar, with cavity hydration apparently taking place in the range of 2\textendash{}3 kbar. However, in the presence of additional mutations that lower the free energy of the excited state, pressure strongly populates the excited state, thereby eliminating the cavity with a native side chain rather than solvent. Thus, both cavity hydration and structure relaxation are mechanisms for cavity elimination under pressure, and which is dominant is determined by details of the energy landscape.},

  abstract = {For a number of proteins, folding occurs via the rapid accumulation of secondary and tertiary structural features in a so-called burst phase, preceding the relatively slow, highly activated transition leading to the native state. A fundamental question is: do these burst phase reactions comprise two phase-separated thermodynamic states or a continuum of states? Ribonuclease HI (RNase H) from Escherichia coli and phage T4 lysozyme (T4L) both exhibit such a phenomenon. Native-state hydrogen exchange (NHX) data have been collected for these proteins, providing residue-specific free energies and m-values (a measure of hydrocarbon solvation) for the manifold of partially unfolded, exchange-competent forms that are accessible from the native state ($\Delta$Gsg and msg, where the sg subscript denotes sub-global). There is good evidence that these parameters pertain to exchange-competent species comprising the burst phase observed in the global folding kinetics. We combine the results from the global folding kinetics of these proteins with a statistical analysis of their NHX parameters to determine if the distribution of experimental (msg, $\Delta$Gsg) values derive from a mechanism where the burst phase is two-state. For RNase H, this analysis demonstrates that the burst phase of this protein is not two-state; the results imply a distribution of states, m and $\Delta$G exhibiting a linear functional relationship consistent with the global folding parameters. For T4L, it is difficult to distinguish the observed distribution of msg, $\Delta$Gsg values from that expected for a mechanism where the burst phase is two-state. The results for RNase H${_\ast}$ lend support for the idea that the burst phase reaction of this protein comprises a continuum of states. This has important implications for how we model the process of structural acquisition in protein folding reactions.},

  abstract = {Proteins are inherently plastic molecules, whose function often critically depends on excursions between different molecular conformations (conformers). However, a rigorous understanding of the relation between a protein/'s structure, dynamics and function remains elusive. This is because many of the conformers on its energy landscape are only transiently formed and marginally populated (less than a few per cent of the total number of molecules), so that they cannot be individually characterized by most biophysical tools. Here we study a lysozyme mutant from phage T4 that binds hydrophobic molecules and populates an excited state transiently (about 1\,ms) to about 3\% at 25\,$^\circ$C (ref. 5). We show that such binding occurs only via the ground state, and present the atomic-level model of the /`invisible/', excited state obtained using a combined strategy of relaxation-dispersion NMR (ref. 6) and CS-Rosetta model building that rationalizes this observation. The model was tested using structure-based design calculations identifying point mutants predicted to stabilize the excited state relative to the ground state. In this way a pair of mutations were introduced, inverting the relative populations of the ground and excited states and altering function. Our results suggest a mechanism for the evolution of a protein/'s function by changing the delicate balance between the states on its energy landscape. More generally, they show that our approach can generate and validate models of excited protein states.},

Research of this kind has led to a wealth of knowledge about what stabilizes proteins in their folded states. To gain a more complete picture requires that we perturb these structures in a continuous manner, something mutagenesis cannot achieve. With high pressure crystallographic methods it is now possible to explore the detailed properties of proteins while continuously varying thermodynamic parameters. Here, we detail the structural response of the cavity-containing mutant L99A of T4 lysozyme, as well as its pseudo wild-type (WT*) counterpart, to hydrostatic pressure. Surprisingly, the cavity has almost no effect on the pressure response: virtually the same changes are observed in WT* as in L99A under pressure. The cavity is most rigid, while other regions deform substantially. This implies that while some residues may increase the thermodynamic stability of a protein, they may also be structurally irrelevant. As recently shown, the cavity fills with water at pressures above 100~MPa while retaining its overall size. The resultant picture of the protein is one in which conformationally fluctuating side groups provide a liquid-like environment, but which also contribute to the rigidity of the peptide backbone.},

  abstract = {Binding selectivity is a requirement for the development of a safe drug, and it is a critical property for chemical probes used in preclinical target validation. Engineering selectivity adds considerable complexity to the rational design of new drugs, as it involves the optimization of multiple binding affinities. Computationally, the prediction of binding selectivity is a challenge, and generally applicable methodologies are still not available to the computational and medicinal chemistry communities. Absolute binding free energy calculations based on alchemical pathways provide a rigorous framework for affinity predictions and could thus offer a general approach to the problem. We evaluated the performance of free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics for the prediction of selectivity by estimating the affinity profile of three bromodomain inhibitors across multiple bromodomain families, and by comparing the results to isothermal titration calorimetry data. Two case studies were considered. In the first one, the affinities of two similar ligands for seven bromodomains were calculated and returned excellent agreement with experiment (mean unsigned error of 0.81 kcal/mol and Pearson correlation of 0.75). In this test case, we also show how the preferred binding orientation of a ligand for different proteins can be estimated via free energy calculations. In the second case, the affinities of a broad-spectrum inhibitor for 22 bromodomains were calculated and returned a more modest accuracy (mean unsigned error of 1.76 kcal/mol and Pearson correlation of 0.48); however, the reparametrization of a sulfonamide moiety improved the agreement with experiment.},

In this study, using in silico tools we designed three Bzt analogs (W49, W51, and W52). By docking, molecular simulations, and chemiluminescent Alpha Screen binding assay, we show that the studied analogs were selective at inhibiting BRD4 when compared to BRD2. Furthermore, we tested the effectiveness of these analogs on osteoclast formation and function. Among the examined analogs, Bzt-W49 and Bzt-W52 were found to be the most potent inhibitors of osteoclastogenesis without cytotoxicity in murine RAW264.7 osteoclast progenitors. Both the compounds also inhibited osteoclast formation without affecting cell viability in human CD14+ monocytes. Moreover, owing to attenuated osteoclastogenesis, actin ring formation and bone resorptive function of osteoclasts were severely perturbed. In conclusion, these results suggest that the novel BRD4-selective Bzt analogs designed in this study could be explored further for developing therapeutics against bone loss diseases characterized by excessive osteoclast activity.},

Due to its role in diverse cellular functions, Brd4 of bromodomain family, was considered as a prominent target for many diseases such as cancer, obesity, kidney disease, lung fibrosis, inflammatory diseases, etc. In this study, an attempt has been made to screen compounds from flavonoids and extended flavonoids libraries targeting acetylated lysine (K Ac) binding site of BD1 of Brd4 using docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Two different docking programs AutoDock and Glide were used to compare their suitability for the receptor. Interestingly, in both the docking programs, the screened flavonoids have occupied the same binding pocket confirming the selection of active site. Further the MMGBSA binding free energy calculations and ADME analysis were carried out on screened compounds to establish their anti-cancerous properties. We have identified a flavonoid which shows docking and Glide e-model score comparatively much higher than those of already reported known inhibitors against Brd4. The protein-ligand complex with top-ranked flavonoid was used for dynamics simulation study for 50 ns in order to validate its stability inside the active site of Brd4 receptor.

This response, although vital for immune defence, is frequently deleterious to the host due to the exaggerated production of inflammatory proteins. The scope of inflammatory responses reflects the activation state of signalling proteins upstream of inflammatory genes as well as signal-induced assembly of nuclear chromatin complexes that support mRNA expression. Recognition of post-translationally modified histones by nuclear proteins that initiate mRNA transcription and support mRNA elongation is a critical step in the regulation of gene expression. Here we present a novel pharmacological approach that targets inflammatory gene expression by interfering with the recognition of acetylated histones by the bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) family of proteins. We describe a synthetic compound (I-BET) that by 'mimicking' acetylated histones disrupts chromatin complexes responsible for the expression of key inflammatory genes in activated macrophages, and confers protection against lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock and bacteria-induced sepsis. Our findings suggest that synthetic compounds specifically targeting proteins that recognize post-translationally modified histones can serve as a new generation of immunomodulatory drugs.},

Screening of more than 30 representative BRDs against systematic histone-peptide arrays identifies new BRD substrates and reveals a strong influence of flanking posttranslational modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, suggesting that BRDs recognize combinations of marks rather than singly acetylated sequences.

In the present study, we report free energy calculations for the binding of seven ligands to the first BRD4 bromodomain, using the attach-pull-release (APR) method to compute the reversible work of removing the ligands from the binding site and then allowing the protein to relax conformationally. We test three different water models, TIP3P, TIP4PEw, and SPC/E, as well as the GAFF and GAFF2 parameter sets for the ligands. Our simulations show that the apo crystal structure of BRD4 is only metastable, with a structural transition happening in the absence of the ligand typically after 20 ns of simulation. We compute the free energy change for this transition with a separate APR calculation on the free protein and include its contribution to the ligand binding free energies, which generally causes an underestimation of the affinities. By testing different water models and ligand parameters, we are also able to assess their influence in our results and determine which one produces the best agreement with the experimental data. Both free energies associated with the conformational change and ligand binding are affected by the choice of water model, with the two sets of ligand parameters affecting their binding free energies to a lesser degree. Across all six combinations of water model and ligand potential function, the Pearson correlation coefficients between calculated and experimental binding free energies range from 0.55 to 0.83, and the root-mean-square errors range from 1.4–3.2 kcal/mol. The current protocol also yields encouraging preliminary results when used to assess the relative stability of ligand poses generated by docking or other methods, as illustrated for two different ligands. Our method takes advantage of the high performance provided by graphics processing units and can readily be applied to other ligands as well as other protein systems.},

The human BRD4 has emerged as a promising drug target for a number of disease pathways, and several potent BRD inhibitors have been discovered experimentally recently. However, the detailed inhibition mechanism especially for the inhibitor binding kinetics is not clear. Herein, by employing classical molecular dynamics (MD) and state-of-the-art density functional QM/MM MD simulations, the dynamic characteristics of ZA-loop in BRD4 are revealed. And then the correlation between binding pocket size and ZA-loop motion is elucidated. Moreover, our simulations found that the compound (-)-JQ1 could be accommodated reasonably in thermodynamics whereas it is infeasible in binding kinetics against BRD4. Its racemate (+)-JQ1 proved to be both thermodynamically reasonable and kinetically achievable against BRD4, which could explain the previous experimental results that (+)-JQ1 shows a high inhibitory effect toward BRD4 (IC50 is 77 nM) while (-)-JQ1 is inactive (>10 μM). Furthermore, the L92/L94/Y97 in the ZA-loop and Asn140 in the BC-loop are identified to be critical residues in (+)-JQ1 binding/releasing kinetics. All these findings shed light on further selective inhibitor design toward BRD family, by exploiting the non-negligible ligand binding kinetics features and flexible ZA-loop motions of BRD, instead of only the static ligand-protein binding affinity.},

Among various members of the bromodomain and extra terminal domain family, BRD4 is found to be an important target for many diseases such as cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, Burkitt's lymphoma, etc. Therefore, in this study an attempt has been made to screen compounds from NCI Diversity, Drug Bank and Toslab Databases targeting the Kac binding site of BRD4 using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, MM-PB/GBSA binding free energy calculations and steered molecular dynamics simulations. Using virtual screening and docking, we have identified 11 inhibitors. These new inhibitors exhibit binding energy values higher than that of the (+)JQ1 inhibitor which is effective against BRD4. However, due to the toxicity of (+)JQ1, the designing of new inhibitors becomes significantly important. Thus, these new 11 ligands were systematically analyzed using other computational investigations. Results reveal that the compounds ZINC01411240, ZINC19632618 and ZINC04818522 could be potential drug candidates for targeting BRD4. It can also be seen from the results that there is a linear relationship between the results obtained from the SMD simulation and free energy obtained from the MM-PBSA/GBSA approach. This study clearly illustrates that the steered molecular dynamics can be effectively used for the design of new inhibitors.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in improved force fields and sampling methods have made it possible for the accurate calculation of protein–ligand binding free energies. Alchemical free energy perturbation (FEP) using an explicit solvent model is one of the most rigorous methods to calculate relative binding free energies. However, for cases where there are high energy barriers separating the relevant conformations that are important for ligand binding, the calculated free energy may depend on the initial conformation used in the simulation due to the lack of complete sampling of all the important regions in phase space. This is particularly true for ligands with multiple possible binding modes separated by high energy barriers, making it difficult to sample all relevant binding modes even with modern enhanced sampling methods. In this paper, we apply a previously developed method that provides a corrected binding free energy for ligands with multiple binding modes by combining the free energy results from multiple alchemical FEP calculations starting from all enumerated poses, and the results are compared with Glide docking and MM-GBSA calculations. From these calculations, the dominant ligand binding mode can also be predicted. We apply this method to a series of ligands that bind to c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 (JNK1) and obtain improved free energy results. The dominant ligand binding modes predicted by this method agree with the available crystallography, while both Glide docking and MM-GBSA calculations incorrectly predict the binding modes for some ligands. The method also helps separate the force field error from the ligand sampling error, such that deviations in the predicted binding free energy from the experimental values likely indicate possible inaccuracies in the force field. An error in the force field for a subset of the ligands studied was identified using this method, and improved free energy results were obtained by correcting the partial charges assigned to the ligands. This improved the root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the predicted binding free energy from 1.9 kcal/mol with the original partial charges to 1.3 kcal/mol with the corrected partial charges.},
