# Benchmark sets for free energy calculations

This repository relates to the *perpetual review* paper called "Predicting binding free energies: Frontiers and benchmarks" by David L. Mobley and Michael Gilson. Its focus is benchmark sets for binding free energy calculations, including the perpetual review paper, but also all things relating to benchmark sets for free energy calculations. This includes discussion, datasets, and standards for datasets and data deposition.

## The paper

The paper was just submitted (Sept. 10, 2016) to bioRxiv and Annual Reviews in Biophysics. Its source files are deposited here, as detailed below, and comments/suggestions, etc. are welcome via the issue tracker (https://github.com/MobleyLab/benchmarksets/issues).

The paper's authors are David L. Mobley (UC Irvine) and Michael K. Gilson (UCSD).

## The vision

Specific contributions there are welcome either via the issue tracker or via pull requests to actually propose changes to the text of the paper itself. The full list of contributors to the updated paper via GitHub can then be appended to subsequent versions of this work, as they would be for a software project.

Community input is needed for updates: Please bring new, relevant work to our attention, including experimental or modeling work on the benchmark systems currently available here, or new work on systems that might make good candidate benchmark systems for the future. Contacting us by e-mail or by raising an issue on the GitHub issue tracker will be the best way to do this.

## The benchmark sets

Currently proposed benchmark sets are detailed in [the paper](https://github.com/MobleyLab/benchmarksets/blob/master/paper/benchmarkset.pdf "Benchmark Sets") and include:
* Host guest systems
    * CB7
    * Gibb deep cavity cavitands (GDCCs) OA and TEMOA
* Lysozyme model binding sites
    * apolar L99A
    * polar L99A/M102Q

Other near-term candidates include:
* Thrombin
* Bromodomains
* Suggest and vote on your favorites via a feature request below

Community involvement is needed to pick and advance the best benchmarks.

## Get involved

We need your help to pick the most informative systems, identify the challenges they present, and help make them standard benchmarks. Please provide your input:

### Vote on what we should do next

For long-term directions, please help us prioritize what we ought to be doing in terms of benchmarks and other changes. Please click below to vote on one of these priorities or to suggest your own (such as addition of specific benchmark systems):

### Submit an issue

If you have a specific suggestion or request relating to the material on GitHub or our paper, please submit a request on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/MobleyLab/benchmarksets/issues).

### Submit a pull request

We also welcome contributions to the material which is already here to extend it (see Section IV in our paper) and encourage you to actually propose changes via a "pull request", even to the paper itself. This will allow us to track your contributions, as well. 

## Manifest

* paper: Provides LaTeX source files for the manuscript as submitted to bioRxiv (reformatted from the version submitted to Ann. Rev. and with 2D structures added to the tables); images, etc. are also available in sub-directories, as is the supporting information.
